This is the hard reality that Costa Rican citizens are facing with no alternative, no other possibility.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Former presidential candidate Rodolfo Piza, from the Social Christian Union Party (Partido Uni\u00f3n Social Cristiana, PUSC), has been the most-discussed alliance. On Thursday, March 8, Piza signed an agreement to establish a national government with PAC, <a href=\"https://www.nacion.com/el-pais/politica/rodolfo-piza-firma-alianza-con-carlos-alvarado/LZPKDMKHONFI5KAYHATLEUNXWA/story/\">according to\u00a0<em>La Naci\u00f3n</em></a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Carlos Alvarado puede ayudarnos a garantizar un gobierno para todos los costarricenses y a garantizar el respeto a sus derechos y el respeto a la igualdad y a la equidad (\u2026).

The structural causes that triggered them not only lay beneath the surface, but have worsened as the political, economic, and social crises worsen. In 2022, blackouts have been aggravated by failures in <a href=\"https://oncubanews.com/cuba/union-electrica-de-cuba-pronostica-una-de-las-peores-jornadas-de-apagones/\">thermoelectric plants</a>, and the shortage of food and medicines has increased. New, bigger protests have emerged after Hurricane Ian left two days of blackout in Cuba in its wake. Cubans have participated in over 30 protests throughout the country since Sept. 29. This is deemed a \u201cnew social outburst\u201d by <a href=\"https://www.radiotelevisionmarti.com/a/m%C3%A1s-de-30-protestas-en-cuba-en-solo-tres-d%C3%ADas-estos-son-los-lugares-donde-ocurrieron/335452.html\">local media</a>.</p>\n<p>In 2021, people <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2021/10/05/hope-amid-scarcity-and-fear-cuba-after-julys-historic-protests/\">took to the streets</a> to protest against the increase in inflation, the dollarization of the economy, and power cuts in the difficult context of the COVID-19 pandemic. After those unforgettable days deemed unprecedented in Cuba, which spread to the rest of the country, life has not changed much. The Cuban regime brutally repressed the protests and the failed civic march called for Nov. 15 of that year, imposing excessive prison sentences on many demonstrators. This context generated a <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2022/02/18/is-authorizing-the-passage-of-cubans-through-nicaragua-a-political-tool/\">migratory crisis</a> with an exodus of Cubans from Nicaragua to the U.S. that exceeds the number of those from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariel_boatlift\">Mariel boatlift</a> in 1980.</p>\n<p>This civic spirit of resistance that was ignited last year has been present in the systematic protests that have taken place in the interior of the country during 2022, especially since June. Most of the protests have been focused in various locations in the provinces because these are the places that suffer the most from blackouts. Before Hurricane Ian, they have been small in comparison with the one that took place on July 11, 2021, in Havana, but they are a sign of the generalized discontent in the country due to the inability of the regime to find solutions to the country's energy problems.</p>\n<h3><strong><em>Cacerolazos</em> and virtual appeals from mothers</strong></h3>\n<p>In recent months, protesters tended to speak out\u00a0against blackouts and food shortages by banging pots and pans, known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cacerolazo\"><em>cacerolazos</em></a>. Many have their faces covered to avoid being identified by the regime's forces.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://observatoriocubano.com/2022/09/01/cuba-361-protestas-en-agosto-siempre-es-11j/\">Observatorio Cubano de Conflictos</a> (the \u201cCuban Observatory of Conflicts\u201d) reports a total of 624 protests between July and August of this year, of which 263 occurred in July and 361 in August. Most of them took place in the form of <em>cacerolazos</em> and were concentrated in the province of Artemisa, followed by Cienfuegos, Holgu\u00edn, and Camag\u00fcey. This is \u201can average of more than 11 public demonstrations per day,\u201d the report states.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"es\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ULTIMAHORA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ULTIMAHORA</a> en <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Holguin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Holguin</a> el pueblo est\u00e1 en la calle por segunda noche consecutiva.

They cry out \u201c<a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2021/04/21/cuban-artists-fight-repression-through-song-social-media-and-hunger-strikes/\">Patria y Vida,</a>\u201d which was the most frequent slogan of the demonstrators last year, and advocate for the change in the political system. Despite the ruthless and systematic repression of the regime, many Cubans are fed up with Cuban socialism and now use social networks to denounce and express social discontent.</p>\n<p>The digital space also has a new element. Women in particular make direct messages on YouTube where they burst out in catharsis expressing their discontent with the crisis, even crying on social media. This usually has an impact online\u00a0\u2014 for example, Amelia Calzadilla's video went viral in June.</p>\n<p>Amelia Calzadilla, an unknown young woman, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhCWGce8Xto\">caught the attention</a> of social media when she demanded better living conditions for herself as a single mother because her salary was barely enough to support her family. Her video went viral on social networks and immediately many mothers were openly in solidarity with Amelia. The impact was such that it set a precedent because the government reached out to her and solved some concrete problems that also affected the quality of life around her, such as access to gas for her street.</p>\n<p>The motto of many mothers (and some fathers) who expressed themselves on social media was \u00a1Todas somos Amelia! (\u201cWe are all Amelia!\u201d), as the first anniversary of July 11 in Cuba approached.</p>\n\n<p>The streets were militarized in concern that more protests would erupt on July 11. In the media sphere, the official spokespersons deployed a propaganda campaign aimed at an artificial image of normality and political stability in the country, especially through their TV program <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnfEA7R7I3s\">Con Filo</a>. During the night of July 11, the program broadcasters expressed that nothing had happened and that this had been a triumph of the Revolution.</p>\n<p>The following day social media reported images of a strong protest with pots and pans in Los Palacios in Pinar del Rio demanding the reestablishment of electricity and freedom.

The #National Population, Household and Housing Census will take place between March and May 2022. It will include questions on gender and ethnic identity for the first time.</p></blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Gender diverse country</strong></h3>\n<p>The inclusion of gender identity in the census will paint a picture of the demographic reality of a significant portion of the Argentine population. A national census not only collects data on the number of inhabitants of a country, but also on their socioeconomic, health, and cultural conditions. This makes it possible to create future public policies suited to the population's varying circumstances. Argentina is the <a href=\"https://provinciaradio.com.ar/noticia.php?noti_id=5234\">first country in South America</a> to capture more information on gender identity.</p>\n<p>In 2019, when the list of questions was made public, Marcela Tobaldi from the <a href=\"https://larosanaranja.org/\">La Rosa Naranja Civil Association</a> and a member of the 100% Diversity and Rights National Network <a href=\"https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/censo-2020-primera-vez-preguntara-identidad-genero_0_R-UdmAepk.html\">told Clar\u00edn newspaper</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tenemos el convencimiento de que terminar con la invisibilidad estad\u00edstica del grupo travesti trans constituir\u00e1 una bisagra en t\u00e9rminos de pol\u00edticas de poblaci\u00f3n, lo que brindar\u00e1 el insumo necesario para el desarrollo de pol\u00edticas p\u00fablicas urgentes de reparaci\u00f3n e inclusi\u00f3n.</span></p></blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"translation\"><p>We are convinced that ending the statistical invisibility of the trans community will lead to a change in population policies. This will provide the data necessary for the development of urgent public policies of reparation and inclusion.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The questionnaire first asks about the respondent's sex recorded at birth, which was assigned by their family. The options are male, female or none of the above. This provides a continuation of previous censuses. The next question asks about the respondent's gender identity and provides eight possible options.</p>\n\n<p>There have been major advances in Argentina for the LGTBIQ+ community since the last census in 2010, including the Equal Marriage Act, the Gender Identity Act, and the Transgender Employment Quota Act. It was therefore important that the new census collected data in accordance with the realities already recognised in existing laws and in society itself.</p>\n<h3><strong>Multi-ethnic Argentina</strong></h3>\n<p>The census also expands on the subject of Indigenous peoples and now includes questions on the self-recognition of people as descendants of these groups and also on the use of their languages. Several Indigenous organisations coordinated the \u2018<a href=\"https://www.anred.org/2022/03/12/soy-de-raices-indigenas-campana-de-cara-al-proximo-censo-nacional/\">Soy de ra\u00edces ind\u00edgenas</a>\u2018 (I am of Indigenous descent) campaign, which encouraged the population to respond proudly to the questions about their roots.</p>\n<p>Ver\u00f3nica Azpiroz Cle\u00f1an is a member of the Mapuche Indigenous people and is part of the <a href=\"https://latinno.net/es/case/1164/#:~:text=El%20Tejido%20de%20Profesionales%20Ind%C3%ADgenas,se%20realizar%C3%A1%20en%20el%202020.\">Indigenous Professionals\u2019 Network</a>. She spoke about the importance of this new question to <a href=\"https://agenciapresentes.org/2022/03/03/como-se-reflejan-las-diversidades-en-el-censo-2022-de-la-argentina/\">Agencia Presentes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lo m\u00e1s importante es que Argentina tiene que mirarse a s\u00ed misma y reconocer que su argentinidad est\u00e1 compuesta por un entrecruzamiento de Pueblos Originarios destinados a desaparecer en el dise\u00f1o de pa\u00eds</span>.

The first thing we need to do is to diminish the level of racism in society. We need the data to show that Argentines did not descend from the ships. The Argentine population is multi-ethnic.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"notes\">\n<p>The mention of ships alludes to a speech made by President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez at a press conference in which he said that \u201cArgentines descended from ships.\u201d This is in turn a reference to the European explorers who came and conquered the continent.</p>\n</div>\n<p>There was however a question in the 2010 census on Afro-descendant identity, but only as a sample on 10 percent of the forms. In the upcoming census, everyone will be asked: \u201cDo you identify as Afro-descendant or do you have black or African ancestors?\u201d</p>\n<p>This is an important step forward for the Afro-Argentine organisations that have fought for decades against the <a href=\"https://elgritodelsur.com.ar/2022/02/un-censo-puede-visibilizar-pero-tambien-hacer-desaparecer-censo-mirada-no-racista.html\">systematic invisibility</a> and myth of a <a href=\"https://www.politicaexterior.com/el-mito-de-la-argentina-blanca-agoniza/\">white and European Argentina</a>, which now seems to be on its way out.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Challenges, controversies, and injunctions</strong></h3>\n<p>While these developments have been welcomed by the communities concerned and by the majority of the population, there has also been criticism voiced from some quarters. For example, one of the first complaints arose from doubts about <a href=\"https://www.infobae.com/politica/2022/03/18/dudas-sobre-el-censo-2022-por-que-hay-que-completar-el-dni-si-el-tramite-es-anonimo/clusion-el-formulario-los-dni-encuestados-n10006791.html\">data protection</a> and the lack of anonymity of the digital census.</p>\n<p>In February, the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ProfesionalesIndigenas\">Indigenous Professionals\u2019 Network</a> filed an <a href=\"http://tiempojudicial.com/2022/02/24/pueblos-originarios-presentan-amparo-para-impedir-la-impresion-de-las-planillas-del-proximo-censo-nacional/\">injunction</a> to prevent the census forms from being printed. They complained that the question concerning ethnic identity did not include a list of Indigenous peoples (it is instead an open question and asks the respondent to name which Indigenous group they belong to), which they believed would result in <a href=\"https://www.pagina12.com.ar/404156-referentes-de-pueblos-originarios-reclaman-que-se-reformulen\">statistical invisibility</a>.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"es\">Adriana Gerez.

Trinidad and Tobago would potentially experience the worst effects should such an oil spill take place.</p>\n<p>There have been\u00a0<a href=\"https://newsday.co.tt/2020/10/19/prevent-spill-from-venezuelan-tanker-in-gulf-of-paria/\">regional</a> and <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/article246561723.html\">international concerns</a>\u00a0in the past months about the potential ecological disaster posed by the damaged vessel, which remains stranded in Venezuelan waters near Trinidad carrying approximately\u00a01.3 million barrels of crude oil.</p>\n<p>Trinidad and Tobago's Minister of Energy Franklin Khan\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.guardian.co.tt/news/khan-assessment-shows-minimal-risk-from-nabarima-6.2.1237599.334e80d616\">said\u00a0</a>on October 22 that the report's findings \u201cconfirmed that the vessel is upright, it is stable and there is very little minimal if any risk of tilting or sinking.\u201d The full report was due to be released on October 22 but prior to this, Khan said the conclusions were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The FSO Nabarima is upright and stable with no visible tilt and there is no imminent risk of tilting or sinking. There was no water egress visible on the vessel to the team, it was confirmed that during the incident when the engine room was flooded, as was reported in September, there was no mixing of oil and bilge water, the oil did not leak from the containment tank. This implies that the double hulls are intact and poses minimum risk of an oil spill at this time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The team was reportedly satisfied with the vessel's ongoing maintenance programme and recommended a follow-up visit in a month.</p>\n<p>On October 16,\u00a0environmental activist Gary Aboud, of the Trinidad and Tobago-based non-governmental organisation (NGO) Fishermen and Friends of the Sea (FFOS), conducted a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.caribois.org/2020/10/activist-risks-life-visiting-fso-nabarima-calls-its-condition-frightening/\">clandestine visit</a>\u00a0to the vessel, showing that it\u00a0was tilting precariously.\u00a0This was two months after Aboud first sounded the alarm about the potential for a devastating oil spill to occur in the Gulf.</p>\n<p>Trinidad and Tobago's government has since found itself grappling with difficult questions about how to respond to a crisis beyond its maritime border. Amery Browne, Trinidad and Tobago's Minister of Foreign and Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Affairs, sought to provide clarity on the government's attempts to address the situation, as Aboud and other environmental activists have <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/FFOSTT/photos/pcb.2797074500615873/2797074463949210/?type=3&amp;theater\">accused</a> local officials of inaction and of toeing the line of the Venezuelan government:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There seemed to be an expectation in some quarters that the government, because of the concern, must act through some kind of illegal means.

Do you think the government negotiated with the gangs or that it did not? 60.2% responded that there is no negotiation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Besides the accusations of negotiating with gangs, Bukele faces other issues that could affect his approval rating. For instance, accusations of <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/07/receta-nayib-bukele-para-limitar-ejercicio-derechos-humanos/\">human rights violations</a>, <a href=\"https://elfaro.net/en/202107/centroamerica/25586/State-Department-Accuses-Four-Senior-Bukele-Officials-of-Corruption.htm\">corruption</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/12/world/americas/el-salvador-journalists-spyware.html\">spying on reporters and activists</a>. As of September 2021, Bukele has also been facing <a href=\"https://elfaro.net/es/202201/ef_foto/25947/Marcha-desaf%C3%ADa-la-orden-presidencial-de-no-celebrar-los-Acuerdos-de-Paz.htm\">regular protests</a>. Different groups of society are protesting his authoritarian governing style, the use of the military for security purposes, and the increasing rates of <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2021/06/13/el-salvador-missing-people-disappearances/\">disappeared persons</a>.</p>\n<h3>Other reasons for Bukele's popularity</h3>\n<p>Nevertheless, despite all the accusations and condemnations, Bukele still has a high probability of maintaining a high approval rating in 2022. Here is why.</p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">First, Bukele is a savvy communicator. Also, he has government-sponsored media outlets, such as <a href=\"https://noticiero.sv/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a TV station</a> and <a href=\"https://diarioelsalvador.com/\">print newspaper</a>,</span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">that help spread the government's messages.</span>\u00a0President Bukele's favorite way of communication is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nayibbukele\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">his Twitter account</a>.</p>\n<p>Second, traditional media outlets critical of Bukele's governance have low credibility among Salvadorans. A <a href=\"https://uca.edu.sv/iudop/wp-content/uploads/Bol.-Eva-de-ano-2021-MOD.pdf#page=39\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2021 survey</a> conducted by a local university revealed that less than 15 percent trusted the investigative newspaper, El Faro, despite it receiving multiple journalism awards. Also, less than 30 percent trusted La Prensa Grafica and El Diario de Hoy, two of the oldest newspapers in the country. These are the principal media outlets that have been reporting on Bukele's alleged negotiation with gangs and corruption cases.</p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Third, political opposition is weak. The two traditional political parties that Bukele and his political party defeated are losing <a href=\"https://www.laprensagrafica.com/elsalvador/Exalcaldes-dejan-las-filas-de-ARENA-y-del-FMLN-20220113-0065.html\">political members.</a>\u00a0</span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The traditional political parties FMLN and ARENA, which were born out of El Salvador's civil war, have lost support due to <a href=\"https://elfaro.net/es/201902/el_salvador/22987/Arena-retrocedi%C3%B3-30-a%C3%B1os-y-el-FMLN-se-derrumba.htm\">years of corruption</a>.</span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The </span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://uca.edu.sv/iudop/wp-content/uploads/Bol.-Eva-de-ano-2021-MOD.pdf#page=39\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">latest UCA survey</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\"> released in January 2022 asked who the preferred political party was; 3.4 percent chose ARENA and 2.2 percent the FMLN.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Support for the president's political party, New Ideas, has also declined. In May 2021, it had a </span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://uca.edu.sv/iudop/wp-content/uploads/Boletin-de-Eva.-de-Gobierno-del-2do-ano-de-NB.pdf#page=34\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">49.6 percent</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0political preference; but, at the end of 2021, it had fallen to\u00a0</span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://uca.edu.sv/iudop/wp-content/uploads/Bol.-Eva-de-ano-2021-MOD.pdf#page=39\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">27.7 percent</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">. This drop could affect Bukele's approval in 2022; however, w</span>ith strong mediatic support, a lack of trust in critical media, and a weak political opposition, Bukele could maintain a high approval rating in 2022 as president.</p>\n</div>", "comments": [{"id": "7639", "news_id": 547, "fallacy": "false dilemma", "comment": "If the people who are being governed like him, I don't understand why this should be an issue.

Despite the global financial crisis between 2008\u20132009, the Turkish economy </span><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-13746679\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">experienced</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a 4.5 percent average annual growth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2004, Turkey received a formal invitation to kick off negotiations over its accession into the European Union. Triumphant Erdo\u011fan, who was prime minister at the time, was determined to showcase that democracy was possible in a Muslim country.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This lasted only a few years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the spring of 2007, the Turkish military released a </span><a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6602775.stm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> saying they were </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/07/how-erdogan-made-turkey-authoritarian-again/492374/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not in favor</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the next presidential candidate (who was appointed by the parliament at the time according to national legislation) favored by the AKP. Somehow, police in Istanbul uncovered a network of plotters planning to overthrow the government. Among many members of the group were military, intelligence, business people, journalists, and academics. Known today as the <a href=\"https://www.esiweb.org/pdf/esi_turkey_tpq_vol10_no1_Dani%20Rodrik.pdf\">Ergenekon case, and the Sledgehammer investigations,</a> the operation led to the prosecutions of several senior military commanders. Years later, <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/article/coups-countercoups-and-journalism-turkey\">evidence emerged</a>, suggesting that both the Ergenekon and Sledgehammer were <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/27/world/europe/turkish-leader-disowns-trials-that-helped-him-tame-military.html\">fabricated</a>.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After these controversies, Turkey </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/07/how-erdogan-made-turkey-authoritarian-again/492374/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">witnessed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> an emboldened party, arrests of government critics, and power consolidation in the hands of the ruling party and its leader.</span></p>\n<p>It was a downhill journey on the democracy front after that. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The constitutional referendum in 2007 replaced the election of the president by the members of the parliament with a direct national vote. The referendum in 2010, granted both the legislative and the executive branches of the government broader powers over judicial appointments. As a result, the AKP leadership was able to gradually erode the judiciary and the military branches of the government, ending any potential barriers to the government's preferred policies.</span></p>\n<h3>Protests and corruption</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2013, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s AKP was faced with its first popular unrest and graft scandal. Known today as the <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/EUR44/022/2013/en/\">Gezi Park protests</a>, anti-government protests spread across 83 cities. Scores of people were arrested during and in the aftermath of Gezi Park protests for questioning police brutality, crony capitalism, and power inequality, all the while riot police used water cannons and tear gas across cities to quash the unrest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That same year, three government ministers </span><a href=\"https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2016/08/turkey-economy-heading-to-turbulent-times.html#ixzz74ZZWjSpT\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">resigned</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as a result of a<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/in-turkey-erdogan-vows-graft-scandal-wont-topple-him/2013/12/29/2cf81270-70b2-11e3-8def-a33011492df2_story.html\"> corruption scandal</a>. Erdo\u011fan, who was prime minister at the time, claimed the allegations were orchestrated by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/world/middleeast/16-more-arrested-as-corruption-inquiry-in-turkey-widens.html\">foreign powers</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And yet, despite the mishandling of the protests, the corruption allegations, and signs of a lagging economy, in 2014, Erdo\u011fan <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28729234\">was elected</a>, as the President of Turkey. But AKP\u2019s biggest selling point \u2014 the economy \u2014 was weakening. Unemployment and inflation were reaching double digits and the Turkish Lira was losing its value quickly. According to</span><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/when-erdogans-turkish-economic-miracle-began-failing-2021-07-15/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reporting</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by Reuters, the Turkish Lira, \u201cshed 75 percent of its value against the dollar since 2013, more than half in the last three years.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the party continued to enjoy relative support. In 2015, AKP secured another landslide victory. Three years later, Erdo\u011fan won his second term as president and his party secured an absolute majority in parliamentary elections that same year, as a result of AKP\u2019s alliance with the far-right Nationalist Movement (MHP) party.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following year, Turkey went through its fourth </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/17/world/europe/as-the-coup-in-turkey-unfolded-the-whole-night-felt-like-doomsday.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">military coup</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Turkey\u2019s president rallied behind his supporter base, calling on them to take the streets, promising to \u201cclean up\u201d the military. \u201cThis attempt, this move, is a great favor from God to us,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said as he arrived in Istanbul from Marmaris where he was reportedly on vacation. \u201cWhy? Because this move will allow us to clean up the armed forces, which needs to be completely clean.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then the <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/07/13/turkeys-post-coup-purge-and-erdogans-private-army-sadat-perincek-gulen/\">purges began</a>.

These arrests <a href=\"https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2021/07/has-erdogan-achieved-his-goal-build-his-new-turkey\">continue</a> to this day.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2018 Turkey officially switched from a parliamentary system to a presidential system which AKP argued would make the government more effective, though </span><a href=\"https://www.swp-berlin.org/en/publication/turkeys-presidential-system-after-two-and-a-half-years/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">experts disagree</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Instead, they say the change <a href=\"https://www.swp-berlin.org/en/publication/turkeys-presidential-system-after-two-and-a-half-years/\">has led to </a></span>a weaker parliament, undermined the separation of powers, politicized the judiciary branch, crippled institutions, and prevalent authoritarian practices.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the country continued to suffer a currency crisis and sharp recession. The ongoing political and economic turmoil resulted in AKP losing five of Turkey\u2019s six largest cities in the 2019 local elections, including Istanbul and the capital Ankara.

So far, the country has administered over 130 million vaccines for first, second, and third doses according to official statistics. Around 80 percent of the country's population has received at least two vaccine doses of vaccine.

Phase 1 of trials began in November 2020. At the time the trials were carried out on 44 volunteers. Phase 2 and 3 were carried out in February 2021 and June 2021 respectively.

This new discourse has been amplified by the political crisis, and by reactions to affirmative action and racial equality politics.</p>\n<p>But, the truth is, black individuals and women are no longer in the places of invisibility once imagined by the ruling classes and by those who held the monopoly of mass consumption representation in Brazil.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>GV: What about institutional racism, how is it reflected in Brazil today?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>O racismo institucional opera, na maioria das vezes, de forma codificada, quando h\u00e1 comportamentos e pr\u00e1ticas orientados por valores excludentes, mas que por vezes se apresentam de forma velada, com express\u00f5es do tipo \u201cesse trabalho n\u00e3o \u00e9 para voc\u00ea\u201d, \u201cprecisamos de outro perfil\u201d.

Take us through your thought processes when jointly pursuing an idea. What makes this collaboration possible?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Farzaneh Safarani (FS):</strong> We studied painting at the University of Tehran, where we were trained traditionally. We were also active in theatre, performance and music. As artists, we always want to explore and discover new things and we always want to speak to the world with our art. So we decided to travel and come to the U.S. in 2014. In our study at Northeastern University, we learned to combine the skills we had acquired in Iran with new concepts, integrating video, performances and installation art into our work.</p>\n<p>We get inspired by the most simple to the most complex experiences in our lives, and the ideas for our works are driven from those experiences. We have been living together so closely for so many years and sharing so many experiences, that we have come to many of the same ideas for our paintings. We used to work separately and in fact, never consciously decided to work together\u2014our collaboration happened organically when we realized how our minds work together, and how we complete each other's thoughts and ideas. And we saw that it worked: our first series of collaborative paintings was very successful. Gradually, our work became increasingly knitted together and now it is like one person working with her other self. When one of us is behind the camera and the other one is performing or posing, we do not need to communicate a word, we both exactly know and feel what we both want.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>OM: What are the major similarities and differences between the art schools in Iran and the one you studied at in Boston?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>FS</strong>: Graduating from the University of Tehran means that you know how to paint and have learned all the necessary skills to bring a 3D image into 2D. We learned all the traditional aesthetic techniques and theories. We were taught not to critique someone's art without being well versed and experienced in the field ourselves. We learned to work with new media, but only after we demonstrated knowledge of all the basics in our field. Collaboration and teamwork were not encouraged.</p>\n<p>Here in the U.S., people at university are supposed to collaborate.\u00a0As an art student in the U.S., you are not required to be a good drawer or painter to be successful; if you want to learn such techniques, you can go and learn them by yourself, elsewhere. We were not required to take specific classes, and could choose what we wanted to do. Here, you learn how to push yourself to be as brave as you can be, to bring out all your hidden abilities and use them in the best way you can.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Bahareh Safarani (BS)</strong>:\u00a0Whatever we know in terms of skills we learned in Iran, and we also self-taught. Here, we learned that art is all about approach and communication and as an artist, it really does not matter what you do \u2014 what matters is how you present your subject and concept. Galleries, collectors, art dealers and society play an essential role in the career and success of an artist; it is [critical] to have their support in order to flourish \u2014 and they have a very delicate job, because they are shaping societal tastes and if they do this poorly, they can do lasting harm.</p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZxWqbRw-FRg\" width=\"640\"><span class=\"mce_SELRES_start\" data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\">\ufeff</span></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>OM: Why did you decide to try media other than painting?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>BS</strong>: Different mediums communicate artists\u2019 ideas in very different ways, and give artists different tools to communicate their message. For example, music is the most abstract art, while literature can be narrative. We know that if we have an idea that we want to depict in a painting, viewers may not get the meaning from the painting that we intended\u2014this is simply a fact about painting. That is why we care about the aesthetic of a painting more than anything else. Video projection can bring the element of time into a still image, and it has brought a mystical and surreal aspect to our paintings. It opens up a new world for audiences, and encourages them to imagine.\u00a0We sometimes integrate performance art as well, because we are aware of the impact of the form. Performances usually include music and are time- and place-specific; in other words, after it is done it is gone, as it was what we wanted for that specific concept.</p></blockquote>\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uIihoOE4ErA?rel=0\" width=\"640\"><span class=\"mce_SELRES_start\" data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\">\ufeff</span></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>OM: Tell us about \u201cReincarnation\u201d, and its paintings overlaid with video projections.

For example, in the painting \u2018Her 5:00 a.m. View\u2019, there are two elements in the painting that represent femininity and masculinity \u2014 the two attitudes she must have in order to survive. In the next painting, \u20185:30 a.m. in the Basement\u2019, she is cleaning away blood. The blood is a symbol of inimical memories and thoughts. Each painting reflects a moment in the daily process, and the decisions and changes she makes in the process of daily self-renewal and strengthening.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p><strong>BS</strong>: One can find differences between this series and our other works.\u00a0For example, the color palette has changed \u2014 we are using lighter colors, such as bluish and greenish grays. The compositions are also simpler \u2014 we are using the empty spaces to expand upon the subject. The figure is not in every painting; she only appears in some, or just in the videos. Overall, changes in our art come from all the changes around us. We want to clear our minds of pessimism. We want to nourish our hopes with the light.

Video adds time to the still image \u2014 but when one watches the video over and over, it becomes a still image. The videos we make for the paintings are very subtle; they give life to the painting, like a breath or heartbeat.

If we can make the audience wake up and realize the world around them and see the beauty in it, it is a huge success.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>OM: In what ways have your works changed since your departure from Iran? How do you connect to the sources of inspiration you had in Iran, in your new home?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>FS</strong>: Our works are about our lives \u2014 that is where we draw our inspiration, conceptually and formally. All the interiors we have painted are actual places we have lived \u2014 so for example, many of the paintings we did in the U.S. have elements of New England architecture. The use of greens and blues in our recent work flows from the beautiful nature around the house where we have been living, so there are many different things that appear in our paintings that come from the environment [in which] we live. Conceptually, the source of our inspiration is ourselves, so even as we change and grow, we never get disconnected from this source of inspiration, no matter where we are.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.royakhadjaviprojects.com/upcoming/2018/6/13/coming-soon\">Reincarnation</a>\u201d opens on October 18, 2018, at the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.elgawimmer.com/contact.html\">Elga Wimmer Gallery</a> in New York City and runs until October 31.</em></strong></p>\n</div>", "comments": [{"id": "5694", "news_id": 299, "fallacy": "slippery slope", "comment": "First they introduce Iranian art.

They get their name because they resemble the iconic Pokemon character. Spanning just five centimeters in length, they are difficult to locate and are a relatively rare find.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>The boxer crab</strong></span></h3>\n\n<p>The Boxer Crab is one of the more interesting creatures found on the Indonesian seabed. It has a symbiotic relationship with stinging sea anemones \u2014 it feeds them in exchange for protection \u2014 and holds them in its front claws to frighten potential predators.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese crabs wield sea anemones attached to their claws in horizontal motions as they move,\u201d says <a href=\"https://sevenseasmedia.org/boxer-crabs-use-sea-anemones-like-pom-poms-jacks-december-underwater-photograph/\">Seven Seas Media</a>, a marine watch group. \u201cThis colorful display serves as a natural deterrent to predators, and when directly threatened, the crab will utilize the sea anemone in a forward, \u2018punching\u2019 movement towards the aggressor.\u201d</p>\n<h3><strong>Emperor shrimp </strong></h3>\n\n<p>These colorful shrimp can grow to a length of 1.9 centimeters and are often found living on larger hosts.</p>\n<h3><strong>A pygmy and common hippocampus</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>\u00a0seahorse</strong></span></h3>\n\n<p>At a maximum of two centimeters, the pygmy seahorse (left) is one of the smallest seahorse species in the world.</p>\n\n<p>It is exclusively found in the <a href=\"https://www.worldwildlife.org/places/coral-triangle#:~:text=The%20Coral%20Triangle%20is%20a,Timor%20Leste%20and%20Solomon%20Islands.\">Coral Triangle</a>, a triangular region spanning from the Philippines and Malaysia in the east to Indonesia and Timor Leste in the south, and the Solomon Islands to the West. This pink seahorse typically resides in pink palm fan corals or other soft corals and seagrasses that allow it to camouflage itself remarkably well.</p>\n<p>The second image is of the common hippocampus seahorse. Like all seahorses, the hippocampus uses its tail as an anchor to bind itself to corals, plants, and other surfaces. It is probably most famous for its <a href=\"https://blog.padi.com/the-only-male-animals-in-the-world-that-get-pregnant-and-give-birth/\">unusual method of reproduction</a>, in which the female produces eggs, which the male incubates through a pouch in its tail until giving birth.</p>\n<h3><strong>Fimbriated moray eel</strong></h3>\n\n<p>The fimbriated moray eel can reach a length of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fimbriated_moray\">81 centimeters</a>. There are over 200 different species of moray eel, most of which are <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/moray-eel-bite\">poisonous</a>. While these eels rarely attack humans, if threatened, they have been known to attack, and their bites contain dangerous toxins. Their razor-sharp teeth can also cause significant bleeding and are <a href=\"https://www.tfhmagazine.com/articles/saltwater/moray-eels-bitebut-are-they-poisonous-full-article\">infamously painful.</a> Most attacks reportedly occur when scuba divers unwittingly put their hands into holes occupied by moray eels.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cuttlefish</strong></h3>\n\n<p>The cuttlefish, or cuttles, is a Cephalopod, cousin to the better-known squid and octopus, and is often hunted to be sold as seafood. They are believed to be one of the smartest invertebrates. <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/invertebrates/facts/cuttlefish#:~:text=Intelligence,to%20be%20unique%20to%20humans.\">According to National Geographic</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Cuttlefish have a large\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/camo/anat-nf.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">brain-to-body size ratio\u2014among the biggest of all invertebrates</a>\u2014which makes them incredibly intelligent.

Presently, their biggest threats are ocean acidification \u2014 changes in the pH of the ocean due to growing carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere and ocean \u2014 and overfishing.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Christmas tree worm</strong></span></h3>\n\n<p>Christmas tree worms are spiral-shaped worms named for their festive, conical appearance. They typically span about 3.8 centimeters long and can be found in many colors, including red, orange, green, and yellow. They use their colorful plumes for <a href=\"https://www.projectnoah.org/spottings/19428013#:~:text=%22Christmas%20tree%20worms%2C%20Spirobranchus%20giganteus,widely%20recognized%20sedentary%20polychaete%20worms%20\">passive feeding and respiration</a>. They are sedentary creatures as the worm burrows into the rock to anchor itself amid current fluctuations. They are very sensitive to the environment around them and, if feeling threatened, will quickly retract into their burrow.</p>\n<h3>Marine threats</h3>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000265625.locale=en\">UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization</a>, \u201cmore than half of the world\u2019s marine species may stand on the brink of extinction by 2100.\u201d They add:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Rising temperatures increase the risk of irreversible loss of marine and coastal ecosystems. Today, widespread changes have been observed, including damage to coral reefs and mangroves that support ocean life, and migration of species to higher latitudes and altitudes where the water could be cooler.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Most of the creatures featured above inhabit Indonesia's reef ecosystems. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About 25 percent of all sealife reside in the \u201crainforests of the sea\u201d \u2014 the coral reefs.

Through his annual portrayal of this tradition, Approo and his troupe, \u201cWarriors of the Black Tribe\u201d, did yeoman's service in preserving this unique aspect of Trinidad and Tobago's cultural heritage. As a consummate \u201cmasman,\u201d he was also skilled at the craft of Carnival creation, making intricately beautiful costumes and papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 masks, some of which are <a href=\"https://newsday.co.tt/2019/08/13/saving-the-toco-folk-museum/\">displayed</a> at the Toco Folk Museum on Trinidad's east coast.</p>\n<p>Writing for Caribbean Beat magazine, academic Dylan Kerrigan <a href=\"https://www.caribbean-beat.com/issue-71/creatures-mas\">noted</a> that Black Indian mas, \u201cthe fiercest of the traditional Indian masquerades,\u201d may well have had roots outside Trinidad and Tobago, with Approo himself suggesting links with runaway slaves in the United States who were taken in by Native American communities in the early 1800s\u2014a \u201ccultural intermingling\u201d that came to fruition in New Orleans\u2019 famous Mardi Gras.</p>\n\n<p>To be an authentic Black Indian, though, was not a matter of external trappings. An integral part of Black Indian masquerade is its own language, sounds and songs, evolving from Indigenous and African languages, the languages of the Spanish, French and English colonisers, and even Hindi, post-emancipation, when plantation owners introduced East Indian indentureship to fill the labour gap. Approo once <a href=\"https://www.caribbean-beat.com/issue-71/creatures-mas\">said</a> this aspect of the mas required commitment and practice: \u201cWe always went to the yard to rehearse our performance before we hit the road, and we chanted a prayer in black Indian language asking for strength.\u201d</p>\n<p>In photographer Maria Nunes\u2019 book <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2018/05/15/trinidadian-photographer-maria-nunes-pays-tribute-to-carnival-dreamers-and-makers-in-new-book/\">\u201cA World of Their Own,\u201d</a>\u00a0which is an ode to traditional mas, fellow Black Indian masquerader <a href=\"https://www.scribblestt.com/mas-death-of-a-warrior\">Darlington \u201cBoysie\u201d Henry</a> said, \u201cNarrie Approo was the Flying Agitan\u2026he's a high grandmaster of language!\u201d</p>\n<p>Another key aspect of the mas is its hierarchical <a href=\"https://www.scribblestt.com/mas-death-of-a-warrior\">structure</a>,\u00a0with the Okenaga (king of the band) and Malerao (queen) in the leadership positions. Then, almost in <a href=\"https://library.artstor.org/#/public/25430944\">military fashion</a>\u2014as <a href=\"https://www.scribblestt.com/mas-death-of-a-warrior\">documented by Nunes</a>\u2014are the Flying Agitan, Wagadaraja, Jeppetok and Jeepnaf\u00adagna, with the Jeeps being the lowest ranking warriors.</p>\n\n<p>Photographer <a href=\"https://abigailimages.photoshelter.com/image/I0000sX.tJ_RClEE\">Abigail Hadeed</a>, who has been documenting Black Indians for decades, is <a href=\"https://www.darklaboratory.com/virtualexhibition/warriorsofhuracan\">most captivated</a> by the fact that the portrayals have a deep spiritual link with the once-banned Orisha faith as masqueraders \u201cdance and chant through the streets [\u2026] rituals of a spiritual nature, wearing mostly black costumes handmade from local <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corbeau\">corbeau</a> feathers, river beads, chip-chip or snail shells, and cow horns.\u201d Though marginalised, she says, by the ever-increasing commercialism of the national festival, practitioners like Approo routinely \u201creclaim with apt ceremony what was denied during slavery and post-emancipation: the freedom of the individual, and of a people, to choose and celebrate their own spirituality, and to express themselves culturally.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Born in San Fernando, in south Trinidad, on April 22, 1927, Approo moved with his family to the capital, Port of Spain, when he was five years old. Living in John John, in an area of Laventille known as \u201cbehind the bridge\u201d\u2014a community rich in the creativity of all things Carnival, including the <a href=\"http://www.steelisland.com/history.asp\">steelpan</a>\u2014Approo first <a href=\"https://www.caribbeanmemoryproject.com/approo-narrie.html\">participated in Carnival</a> in 1934, playing his first <a href=\"https://www.caribbean-beat.com/issue-57/come-turn-yourself-on\">Black Indian mas</a> at the age of 11.</p>\n<p>Inundating himself in every aspect of the festival, he also played tenor pan with a steelband called <a href=\"https://whensteeltalks.ning.com/video/the-cross-of-lorraine-1944-trailer\">\u201cCross of Lorraine\u201d</a> (now known as \u201cAll Stars\u201d). Back in those early days of the instrument finding its footing, the steelband movement <a href=\"https://natt.gov.tt/new/node/232\">garnered a reputation</a> for being explosive, and violent clashes between different pan sides were not unusual. Approo experienced one of these scuffles when Cross of Lorraine got caught in the crosshairs of a fight between two other pan sides\u2014\u201dInvaders\u201d and \u201cTokyo\u201d\u2014on Carnival Monday, 1946. But Black Indian mas was where his heart was, and Approo <a href=\"https://www.caribbean-beat.com/issue-71/creatures-mas\">described</a> it as \u201cfighting mas,\u201d which began with battles of language and skill and occasionally transmuted, just as the steelband wars did, into physical altercations.</p>\n\n<p>Approo realised the importance of preserving his life's work in order for such Carnival traditions to be handed down. On February 12, 2021, he <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/UWISTA.AlmaJordanLibrary/posts/3403040819825086\">donated</a> his extensive Carnival collection to the Alma Jordan Library at The University of the West Indies\u2019 St. Augustine campus in Trinidad and Tobago. Kathryn Chan, who <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/kathrynlydiachan/posts/10158369577033517\">curated the collection</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/kathrynlydiachan/posts/10158380655333517\">said</a> on Facebook:</p>\n<blockquote><p>What a relief that Narrie Approo's work will be in a safe location and preserved (away from the threats of mildew, floods, fire etc). I now see that this is just the beginning. It was a very small and short gathering to honour Narrie, to take him to see The Alma Jordan library where his works will live on [\u2026] After Covid times, the universe willing, maybe I can take him back to see the actual collection. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>This collection is only possible because Narrie was the chief archivist. He would have photographs taken every year, hunt down and collect any of him and his fellow mas players and place them in chronological order in multiple albums that date back to the 1960's. He saved articles and movie posters that he studied to make his own costumes. It is truly due to his own meticulousness that all of this has survived.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>In 2018, Approo <a href=\"https://trinidadexpress.com/opinion/editorials/saluting-service-and-excellence/article_c865692a-bf94-11e8-9426-bf56e102dd07.html\">received</a> the Hummingbird Medal, a national award, for his significant contribution to Carnival culture. It was also the year he would make his <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/soyini.grey/posts/10160085468140615\">last public appearance</a> as a Black Indian, coming out to pay tribute to his friend \u201cBoysie\u201d Henry who had recently died.</p>\n<p>Upon learning of Approo's death, Maria Nunes shared some of her photographs on Facebook, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/marianunestrinidad/posts/10160198611889874\">saying</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Narrie Approo \u2013 Masman Extraordinaire.

But in Belarus, where the opposition is disputing Alyaksandr Lukashenka's hold on power after the August 9 presidential election, the revolution is not being just broadcast over social media \u2014 it's being embroidered.</p>\n<p>The official results of these presidential elections, announced on August 10, gave Lukashenka\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/alexander-lukashenko-wins-belarus-election/a-54506718\">over 80 percent of the vote</a>, while the leader of the recomposed opposition<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sviatlana_Tsikhanouskaya\">\u00a0Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya</a> gained less than 10 percent.

But for the government in Minsk, the elections are a done deal, and no further discussion is forthcoming. Furthermore, internet access has been cut off throughout the country since late August 9. This means that most Belarusians have great difficulty finding out about ongoing protests across the country, in which the police have used violence against protesters. Over 5,000 have been arrested and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.vesti.ru/article/2438531\">one death</a>\u00a0has been reported.</p>\n<div class=\"factbox\">\n<p><strong>Read more: <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2020/08/10/belarus-shuts-down-internet-as-thousands-protest-election-results/\">Belarus shuts down internet as thousands protest election results</a></strong></p>\n</div>\n<p>Since Lukashenka came to power in 1994, this eastern European country of nearly 10 million has never held a free and fair election. Although these protests are the largest in recent years, previous elections in Belarus have prompted similar responses, followed by crackdowns and mass arrests. Historical memory of any trace of protest is thus erased from the public consciousness.</p>\n\n<p>That's why one Belarusian artist has decided to immortalise the protests of August 2020 through embroidery. Rufina Bazlova, who lives in Prague and has studied art in the Czech Republic, has chosen an idiom close to the hearts of many Belarusians: red embroidery on a white background. For many years after independence, this kind of embroidery was a key part of Belarusian folklore, used to promote the country in tourist adverts.</p>\n<p>But it also has a political connotation. During Belarus's independence after the collapse of the Russian Empire, the country used a white-red-white flag as its tricolour. It harked back to the days of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth of which Belarus was a component, but its newfound independence was short-lived: the state was reabsorbed into the Soviet Union in 1919. So when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, it once again became the flag of independent Belarus and asserted a Belarusian identity distinct from Russia. But in 1995, Lukashenka restored the green and red flag of Soviet Belarus (albeit without the hammer and sickle), thereby making the red-white-red flag a symbol of resistance to his rule.</p>\n<p>That symbolism continues to this day. It is often seen in the current protests, where it serves as a symbol of resistance to the current regime, explains Max \u0160\u010dur, a Belarusian-language writer and activist who lives in Prague, the Czech capital:</p>\n<blockquote><p>What we are witnessing now in Minsk and Belarus is\u00a0a democratic revolution, civic society is being born. Belarusian cultural identity is complicated, but right now it's all about democratic values and an active anti-regime position. It's a \u201ccivic\u201d, not \u201cethnic\u201d model of society in progress</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ales Plotka, a singer and civic activist from Belarus also based in Prague, agrees. However, he says that the status of the flag is somewhat ambiguous:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The white-red-white flag is a common symbol of resistance against this unfair government. It was associated with the traditional opposition in the past, and demonised by Lukashenko ideologists, but is now used country-wide by all sorts of people.\u00a0There is no official ban on it, as it is really a historical flag, known for over seven centuries. Sometimes people carrying it are attacked, usually by the police. During events celebrating the anniversary of the independent Belarusan Democratic Republic [1918-1919], it was widely used, and people leaving the area were temporarily arrested for carrying it. But today, the more it is used and recognised, the less often people carrying it are attacked.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Therefore Bazlova's work has a potent political symbolism. This can be seen in her choice of events to embroider, such as the case of two DJs who hacked a pro-Lukashenka event by suddenly playing a song by the late Soviet rock musician\u00a0<a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2020/06/20/viktor-tsoi-the-undying-icon-of-soviet-rock-and-dissidence/\">Viktor Tsoi</a>\u00a0about the need for change, which has become something of a protest anthem used by the opposition to rally people against Lukashenka.</p>\n\n<p>Bazlova, who is Belarusian but has lived in the Czech Republic since 2008, told GlobalVoices what motivates her work:</p>\n<blockquote><p>V \u010cesk\u00e9 republice \u017eiji ji\u017e 12 let.

On the way to the pharmacy she noticed a car following. Inside were two men, one a friend of her neighbor's, who offered her a ride. When she refused, the man clamped her mouth shut and forced her into the vehicle. The two men drove the girl to her neighbor\u2019s house, from where she managed to call the police. However, her own relatives rejected her, saying she had brought disgrace on the family.

In April 2021, in Bishkek, a group of five men abducted 26-year-old Aizada. Two days later, a local shepherd found the bodies of the abducted woman and one of her kidnappers inside a car between the villages of Arashan and Chokmorova in the Chuy region. These cases triggered outraged protests, with calls for dismi<span style=\"color: #000000;\">ssals of officials and other legal acti</span>ons, and a push to change the legal provisions around bride-kidnapping. Currently, <a href=\"http://cbd.minjust.gov.kg/act/view/ru-ru/112309\">a new criminal code</a>, adopted in October 2021, provides for liability in the form of imprisonment from up to seven years for kidnapping.</p>\n\n<p>Sexual abuse of underage girls has also filled the news feeds in past weeks.

It must be noted, however, that this increase in numbers is unlikely to be only from a rapid increase in cases, as reporting and recording of gender-based violence has gone up\u00a0 because society has begun to pay more attention to gender issues.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Kyrgyz society is still <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/your-traditions-our-blood-the-struggle-against-patriarchal-violence-in-kyrgyzstan/\">patriarchal</a> and <a href=\"https://www.swp-berlin.org/10.18449/2021C08/\">neo-traditionalist</a> in many respects, still assigning a secondary role to women and not allowing them to control their fates. This aspect is of primary importance, influencing social attitudes, gender policy and the regulation of gender-based violence in Kyrgyzstan. <span style=\"color: #000000;\">Despite </span>the country\u2019s pledge to take the path of democracy following the collapse of the Soviet Union, domestic violence and trafficking in women, bride kidnapping, child marriages and <a href=\"https://oxussociety.org/kelinism-in-kyrgyzstan-womens-rights-versus-traditional-values/\">kelinism</a> (forced subordination of new brides to their mothers-in-law and relatives of their husbands) are still practiced in Kyrgyzstan, <span style=\"color: #000000;\">although </span>formally criminalized.</p>\n<p>In turn, the revival of Islamic sentiments also adds fuel to this bonfire, sometimes undermining the position of women, and religious officials often speak on gender issues with discriminatory rhetoric against women. Thus, a video of a sermon from July 6, 2022 by Sadybakas Doolov, the imam of one of the districts of Bishkek, caused social media outrage, as he claimed that the <a href=\"https://rus.azattyk.org/a/31939811.html\">increase in meat prices in markets is due to the reduction in the value of \u201cwomen\u2019s meat,\u201d</a> reflected in their short dresses.

Muslim was forced to resign, but was <a href=\"http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/11/14/jailed-for-reporting-her-sexual-offender-mataram-woman-cries-for-help.html\">later hired</a> by a local-level youth and sport agency.</p>\n<div class=\"factbox\">\n\n<p>Comic translation, by panel, starting at top left. 1. Baiq Nuril, a former administrative teacher of SMAN 7 state high school, mother of three, a sexual harassment victim. 2. The man has verbally harassed her since mid-2012. Tired of being accused of having extramarital affairs with the man, she recorded one of his calls, but didn't report it out of fear of losing her job. 3. Her colleague posted the recording on a WhatsApp group. Out of shame, her boss pressed charges against her using UU ITE. 4. Mataram District Court dismissed her from all charges, but Supreme Court punished her, while her harasser got a promotion within the City of Mataram. 5. The children discuss how other sexual violence victims are being sidelined by the justice system.</p>\n</div>\n<p>In retaliation, Muslim sued Nuril for defamation. The Mataram District Court acquitted Nuril and declared her to be a victim of sexual harassment. But the prosecution appealed the ruling in the Indonesian Supreme Court which found that Nuril had violated the Electronic Information and Transactions (UU ITE) law, which falls under Indonesia's criminal code.</p>\n<p>The court found that Nuril was guilty under two sections of Article 27 of the ITE law. The first criminalizes \u201cdeliberately and without permission creating/ distributing/ making available online a pornographic content\u201d, while the second addresses \u201cdeliberately and without permission creating/ distributing/ making available online an online content that contains insults/defamation.\u201d</p>\n<p>In addition to serving a six-month prison sentence, Nuril was ordered to pay a fine of 500 billion Rupiah (nearly USD $34,000). Public school teachers in NTB province typically earn USD $125 per month.</p>\n<h3><strong>The campaign to #SaveIbuNuril</strong></h3>\n<p>Various groups have helped launch the #SaveIbuNuril campaign aimed at defending Nuril\u2019s freedom. Indonesians call someone \u201cIbu\u201d as a sign of respect and affection for a female teacher, or an older maternal figure.</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/jokowi-beri-amnesti-untuk-bu-nuril-amnestiuntuknuril/sign?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=aa_sign&amp;utm_campaign=455941&amp;utm_content=&amp;sfmc_tk=1HapyyssBrfriDvG2c9c3Snq7DUdgxzh7tminhXFvrbMO%2bgHURxrprO5FMx3x8AI&amp;j=455941&amp;sfmc_sub=267052245&amp;l=32_HTML&amp;u=65840448&amp;mid=7259821&amp;jb=499\">online petition</a> demanding President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) grant amnesty to Nuril has been signed by more than 162,000 people.</p>\n<p>But despite the overwhelming public support for Nuril, Jokowi says he won't <a href=\"http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/11/20/jokowi-wont-grant-nuril-amnesty.html\">intervene</a> with the Supreme Court's decision. He has advised Nuril to seek a case review or apply for <em>grasi</em> (presidential clemency) when her punishment is in force.</p>\n<p>The Institute for Criminal Justice Reform (ICJR) <a href=\"https://www.cnnindonesia.com/nasional/20181115172505-12-346896/icjr-desak-jokowi-berikan-amnesti-untuk-baiq-nuril\">criticized</a> the president's statement and questioned his commitment to protect women and other victims of sexual harassment in the country.</p>\n<p>A crowdfunding campaign was also <a href=\"https://kitabisa.com/saveibunuril\">initiated</a> to pay Nuril\u2019s fine. As of this writing, the campaign has already raised USD $22,500.</p>\n<h3><strong>Advocates seek repeal of defamation law</strong></h3>\n<p>Nuril\u2019s case has further highlighted the need to review Article 27 of the UU ITE law. According to the Southeast Asia Freedom of Expression Network (SAFENet), this provision is often used by those in government to silence their critics. SAFENet has monitored 245 cases linked to the UU ITE law, 174 of which are defamation-related.</p>\n<p>Responding to the petition to reform the UU ITE law, Indonesian Minister of Communication and Information (Menkominfo) Rudiantara <a href=\"https://katadata.co.id/berita/2018/11/17/hormati-putusan-ma-rudiantara-minta-usut-penyebar-konten-guru-nuril\">emphasized</a> that while he sympathizes with Nuril's plight, he insisted that the law needs no revisions. He added that the police should track down the real culprit who spread the recording made by Nuril. His response worried digital rights groups, who fear the vague law will not be amended and that more victims may face the same fate as Nuril in the future.</p>\n<p>When I spoke with a representative of the Association of Victims of UU ITE (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/pakuite\">PakuITE</a>), they explained why the law is repressive:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The application of UU ITE is ineffective, the articles of the law are open to many interpretation. They're unnecessary, and methodically used to target critics and those who are vocal against the governments\u2019 policies, those who seek justice. The government is actively asking the inputs from the public regarding their work performances. But how can we do that if we're risked being punished for our online updates? Our data shows that 90% of the time the law is being used to counter sue, to threaten, and used as vengeance, and to silence individuals.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Succumbing to the public pressure, the Office of the Attorney General decided on 19 November 2018 to <a href=\"https://nasional.kompas.com/read/2018/11/19/22420301/kejagung-tunda-eksekusi-penahanan-baiq-nuril\">postpone</a> <a href=\"https://nasional.kompas.com/read/2018/11/19/22420301/kejagung-tunda-eksekusi-penahanan-baiq-nuril\">Nuril\u2019s punishment</a>.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, there have been no legal measures taken against Muslim, despite the first instance court ruling and evidence that he sexually harassed multiple teachers who were once among his staff. Mataram, the city where he is now employed as chief of the Division of Youth and Sport, has <a href=\"http://lombokpost.net/2018/11/22/muslim-masih-duduk-manis/\">vowed not to take action</a> against him.</p>\n</div>", "comments": [{"id": "7522", "news_id": 508, "fallacy": "none", "comment": "What a ridiculous use of the law.

[\u2026]</p>\n<p>I also loved learning about Barbados culture. I had the privilege of enjoying a private cooking demo of fried flying fish with cou-cou (corn flour and okra) and sauce\u2013the national dish of Barbados. It was also fascinating to hear conversations in Bayan Creole and learn Caribbean slang.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The culture of street harassment, however, would soon take its toll. Lo described it as more difficult to negotiate than COVID-19 lockdowns and the volcanic ash that held Barbados in a stranglehold after the <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2021/04/12/the-longer-la-soufrieres-activity-lasts-the-more-dire-st-vincents-situation-becomes/\">intense eruptions</a> of St. Vincent and the Grenadines\u2019 <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2021/04/09/explosive-eruption-confirmed-at-st-vincents-la-soufriere-volcano/\">La Soufri\u00e8re</a> in <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2021/04/13/st-vincents-la-soufriere-explodes-again-on-42nd-anniversary-of-last-major-eruption/\">April 2021</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Although street harassment is not unique to the island, I had never felt as fearful and vulnerable as I did in Barbados\nCatcalling happened almost every time I left the house. [\u2026]\nThis ranged from one man saying he wanted to \u2018put his aloe vera on me\u2019 while I was taking pictures of the beach to another yelling, \u2018Leave this prey alone!\u2019 when I adjusted my shorts while walking.</p>\n<p>I knew catcalling was happening in Barbados and the local women assured me that it was largely harmless. And at first I tried to laugh about it.</p>\n<p>But as I continued to explore my new home on my own, I saw more incidents that filled me with fear.</p>\n<p>I was warned that solo women on the beach could attract unwanted attention. Once a man was sitting next to me trying to have a conversation. I gave him one word answers before finally ignoring him. He sat and stared at me in silence. When I pretended to pack and leave, he left.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Such interactions left her feeling \u201cincreasingly paranoid and withdrawn\u201d as she sank \u201cdeep into a rabbit hole of panic and despair.\u201d Lo says she carried a rape alarm and a Swiss Army knife with her wherever she went, and even wore a \u201cfake wedding ring\u201d in an attempt to divert unwanted attention. What surprised her, she said, is that none of her research prior to the move hinted at the pervasiveness of this type of pestering:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Some friends in Barbados speculated that the excessive attention was due to my being an Asian with pink hair.</p>\n<p>Local women said to me, \u2018But that\u2019s how Caribbean men are.\u2019 One said if I wanted to live in the Caribbean I would have to accept that.</p></blockquote>\n<p>However, Caribbean women have been standing up and speaking out against verbal molestation and other forms of gender-based abuse for years now. In 2016, the <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2016/12/02/caribbean-women-take-their-power-back-by-sharing-stories-of-sexual-abuse-via-the-lifeinleggings-hashtag/\">#LifeinLeggings</a> hashtag, created by two Barbadian women as a way to give women a voice\u2014and a space in which to share their stories of sexual harassment\u2014resonated throughout the region as it <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2021/02/03/in-trinidad-tobago-where-women-are-under-siege-sometimes-even-words-feel-futile/\">underscored</a> the <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2016/02/15/citizens-protest-against-trinidad-mayors-vulgar-victim-blaming-statements/\">extent</a> to which sexual harassment is ingrained in the <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2020/12/17/trinidadian-comedian-uses-humour-to-say-gender-based-violence-isnt-funny/\">collective</a> regional <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2021/02/23/trinidad-tobagos-problem-with-gender-based-violence/\">culture</a>.</p>\n<p>Other regional initiatives working against gender-based violence include Jamaica's <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2017/02/07/tambourine-army-gathers-recruits-as-jamaicans-anger-over-child-sexual-abuse-grows/\">Tambourine Army</a> and the hashtag #LeaveMeAlone, taken from <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2017/02/09/trinidad-tobagos-carnival-2017-playlist-part-1/\">a song</a> by Trinidad and Tobago's Calypso Rose, which activist Attillah Springer <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2017/02/07/trinidad-tobagos-prime-minister-says-women-should-choose-their-men-more-wisely-to-avoid-violence/\">used as a mechanism</a> to have discussions about gender-based violence in the context of the country's annual Carnival celebrations. Both movements were started in 2017.</p>\n<p>For Lo, the last straw was an incident that took place as she was walking to her neighbourhood supermarket one afternoon:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The streets were empty. A man drove by and stopped next to me. He said he was selling beach chairs and then he told me to get in the car.</p>\n<p>\u2018I\u2019m fine, thank you,\u2019 I replied.</p>\n<p>He became aggressive: \u2018I\u2019m trying to get in touch with you, but you don\u2019t care about me.\u2019</p>\n<p>I replied, \u2018I\u2019m fine on my own.\u2019</p>\n<p>\u2018Don\u2019t you want a husband?\u2019 He asked. I said no and he drove off. But I froze in fear, too panicked to write down his license plate.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The property manager at Lo's apartment complex reported the incident to the police, though as far as Lo is aware, \u201cthe driver was never caught.\u201d It was only after this experience that Lo learned about <a href=\"https://www.queensyoungleaders.com/awardee/ronelle-king/\">Ronelle King</a>, the co-founder of #LifeinLeggings, who \u201cwas on her way to the capital Bridgetown in 2016, when a man offered her a ride. She refused and he tried to drag her into the car.\u201d King <a href=\"https://onlineworknews.top/why-i-left-a-remote-work-year-in-barbados-early/?fbclid=IwAR2yzcI4eDwvUg-8Pvjtnj4R7uq8FhPB_p1VJTOJpw-wH2qood_3B25d6p8\">explained</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Harassment of women and girls in Barbados is a widespread and ubiquitous issue [\u2026] one of those crimes that has been normalized as \u2018part of culture\u2019, trivialized to be considered a masculine way of showing their interest in a woman they are attracted to.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is an aspect of the Barbados reality that is at cross-purposes with Prime Minister Mia Mottley's <a href=\"https://barbadoswelcomestamp.bb/\">statement</a> on the Welcome Stamp website, which promised visitors \u201csafety and security\u201d in this \u201cideal place to live, for both singles and families.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lo says her decision to return to Hong Kong was one that filled her with \u201cenormous relief,\u201d though she wondered what she might have done differently:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Maybe I was stupid to move to a place I\u2019d never been to. As a woman, I would not have gone there alone if I had known the reality. Sometimes I wonder if I should have done that at all. So much of what happened was completely unexpected.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This tendency for women to second guess themselves is the very thing that Caribbean feminists are trying to change as they <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2016/02/15/citizens-protest-against-trinidad-mayors-vulgar-victim-blaming-statements/\">advocate</a> for proper socialisation of boys and for men\u2014whether they be ordinary citizens or <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2016/01/07/could-cricketer-chris-gayles-gaffe-inspire-caribbean-men-to-man-up-and-know-how-to-behave/\">regional celebrities</a>\u2014to take responsibility for their actions and make the necessary changes.</p>\n</div>", "comments": [{"id": "3799", "news_id": 117, "fallacy": "none", "comment": "This must stop.

In 1928, after the attempted ordination of two women, Prince Bhujong Jombunud Siriva\u1e0d\u1e0dhano, then the Supreme Patriarch of Thailand, issued an edict forbidding monks from ordaining women as monks or novices. The Sangha Supreme Council of Thailand also issued two rulings in 1984 and 1987 forbidding the ordination of women. However, the Sangha Act of 1962, the secular law governing Thai monastics, and the 1992 amendment do not prohibit the ordination of women.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the National Human Rights Commission of Thailand (NHRC) ruled in 2015 that the Sangha Supreme Council\u2019s prohibition of the ordination of women is a violation of the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), to which Thailand is a state party. NHRC also ruled that such prohibition is in violation of the Thai Constitution and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), both of which protect freedom of religion.</p>\n<p>Dhammananda\u2019s efforts to re-establish the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhikkhun%C4%AB\">Theravada bhikkhuni\u00a0</a>lineage in Thailand have been met with resistance from both the laity and monks who are against ordaining women, most of whom have claimed that the ordination of women is not possible as the Theravada bhikkhuni lineage has already died out. <em>\u2018Bhikkhuni\u2019</em> refers to a fully ordained female monastic. Despite the lack of secular law prohibiting the ordination of women, bhikkunis are seen as a foreign tradition and the two main Buddhist orders in Thailand have yet to officially accept ordained women as part of the Sangha \u2013 the Buddhist community of monastics.</p>\n<p>Dhammananda is currently the abbess of the Songdhammakalyani Monastery in Nakhon Pathom, founded by her mother Voramai Kabilsingh, who was ordained as a monk in the Taiwanese Dharmaguptaka lineage in 1971, receiving the religious name Ta Tao Fa Tzu. The monastery is currently Thailand\u2019s only all-female temple. Varanggana Vanavichayen, the first woman to be ordained as a monk on Thai soil, was ordained at the Songdhammakalyani Monastery in 2002.</p>\n<p>However, the Thai authorities do not recognize the monastery as a Buddhist temple, and when Dhammananda and other monks from the monastery went to pay respect to the late King Bhumibol at the Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall, where his body lay in state, they were denied entry. The officials claimed that they were turned away on the grounds that it is illegal for women to wear the saffron robe under Thai Buddhism. 22 other female monks and novices were also turned away after being told that they would be only be allowed to pay their respect to the late King if they removed their robes and wore the regular black clothing of laypeople.</p>\n<p>The BBC\u2019s 100 Women list includes those who \u201chad made the headlines or influenced important stories over the past 12 months, as well as those who have inspiring stories to tell, achieved something significant or influenced their societies in ways that wouldn't necessarily make the news.\u201d</p>\n<p>The theme for 2019 is \u201cthe Female Future\u201d and the list also includes Kuwaiti women\u2019s rights activist Alanoud Alsharekh, who works on the abolition of Kuwait\u2019s \u201chonour-killing\u201d law; Japanese model and author Yumi Ishikawa, founder of the #KuToo campaign against the requirement for women to wear high heels at work; sumo wrestler Hiyori Kon, who fought to change the rules which barred women from competing professionally in sumo; US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the youngest woman ever to serve in the US congress; Filipino journalist and press freedom advocate Maria Ressa, an outspoken critic of President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s \u2018war on drugs\u2019; and Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg, whose school strike protests mobilized millions of young people around the world, forming the \u2018Fridays for future\u2019 movement.</p>\n</div>", "comments": [{"id": "5644", "news_id": 282, "fallacy": "appeal to worse problems", "comment": "If it is still an issue in Thailand for women to be monks, then its safe to say that all women there also face much worse problems such as equality under the law, etc. Maybe women should focus on the sexism that affects all women there before they try to change religious issues like becoming a monk.

An edited version is republished here under a content-sharing agreement between Global Voices and Metamorphosis Foundation.\u00a0</em></p>\n<p>Dozens of citizens of North Macedonia and Ukrainians residing in Skopje protested against the Russian invasion of Ukraine through a march from the main square of North Macedonia's capital to the Russian embassy on February 25. They sang Ukrainian songs and shouted \u201cPutin is a fascist, Putin is a murderer\u201d while carrying signs \u201cRussia keep off Ukraine\u201d and \u201cStay calm and love Ukraine.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Many of\u00a0the protesters interviewed by Meta.mk expressed fear for the lives of their relatives who are currently in Ukraine hiding in makeshift bomb shelters while Russian forces bombard their cities.</p>\n<p>\u201cI'm full of emotions, I can't restrain myself. My family is in Ukraine, and we are all the same. We are all one family. Every minute I write to my relatives: Tell me if you are alive? God\u00a0protect Ukraine, protect the soldiers, they defend us,\u201d a tearful Olja\u00a0Obrezhina said to a Meta.mk reporter. This statement in Ukrainian is in the following video:</p>\n\n<p>After the march came near the\u00a0Russian Embassy, the protesters stopped in front of a police cordon about 20 meters from the embassy fence. The president of the Association of\u00a0Ukrainians in Macedonia, Aleksandar Panovich, gave a statement for the media while standing among protesters carrying Ukrainian symbols and anti-war signs, as well as posters presenting Putin masked as Hitler. Panovich said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our main message is for Russia to stop the war, to take\u00a0 their army back home. Starting a war is shameful. Our message is for\u00a0them to make a diplomatic agreement. The Ukrainian people are ready to fight, they are ready for war. But we don't understand why they bomb us, why do they bomb peaceful cities with rockets.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>A journalist from Afghanistan who identified himself as Karan also spoke in front of the Russian embassy, and highlighted that he knows how it feels to be exiled.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I came to give support to Ukraine, because I know how it feels to be banished from your own home due to war and aggression of outside\u00a0forces.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Pointing to the metal fence of the Russian embassy in Skopje, the protesters said it's easy to judge who the aggressor is since the Ukrainian embassy is open and nobody there is afraid of visitors, while the Russian embassy is<a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/?attachment_id=757191\"> guarded by police</a> even though it's surrounded by metal bars.</p>\n<p>Ukrainian citizen Andrej Hafenic called out Russia for being an aggressor:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Russia\u00a0 is the aggressor. In the 21st century we have been forced to come to the\u00a0embassy of the aggressor and tell them it's not normal for people to get killed so Putin can remain in power. Our military is capable of resistance, but we reiterate, diplomacy should come first. This conflict should be solved at the diplomatic level, to stop the war and to achieve peace. Peace in Ukraine, peace in Europe, peace in the Balkans.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Kujtim Osmani, one of the local citizens present at the protest, expressed solidarity to Ukrainians:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We want the people to know what Putin does in Ukraine, that this [war] is a human rights violation. I am sorry for all those little children and mothers who suffer. I don't have family or friends in Ukraine, but\u00a0 I accidentally saw [the information about the protest] on Twitter and came to express my support. It's saddening what happens to the people.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Three days\u00a0before the protest, the Association of Ukrainians \u201cLesya Ukrainka\u201d (named after a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesya_Ukrainka\">19th century writer</a>) and representatives from the Ukrainian Embassy also organized a joint action at the <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Taras_shevchenko_skopje_sculpture.jpg\">Taras Shevchenko monument</a> in the center of Skopje, under the motto \u201cunited for Ukraine\u201d.</p>\n<p>The aim of that public action was to demonstrate togetherness and unity of Ukrainians around the world and support Ukraine's right to choose its own future. At the occasion, the president of the association Aleksandar Urbanovich <a href=\"https://civil.today/the-association-of-ukrainians-lesya-ukrainka-in-skopje-held-a-joint-action-standwithukraine/\">said</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ukraine is at the front line of defending democracy and freedom. We call for a united front that will strive for the protection of joint European values and will remain determined to oppose the aggressor. Even when we are abroad, Ukraine remains in our hearts and we stand together with our homeland!</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Thousands of Ukrainians living in European and American cities and their friends protested in front of Russian embassies and consulates around the world to send a message of stopping the Russian invasion over Ukraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>For more information about this topic, see our special coverage <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/special/russia-invades-ukraine/\">Russia invades Ukraine</a>.</h3>\n</div>", "comments": [{"id": "2998", "news_id": 0, "fallacy": "none", "comment": "Offering my support for Ukraine, the war waged by Putin-led Russia is barbaric and it's high time that world leaders and international agencies unite to see an end to this.

Her translations have been published in a number of leading English-language magazines, and three translations of books by Uzbek and Kazakh authors are coming out later this year. As Central Asian literature remains scarcely known outside the region, Shelley is not just a translator but also a cultural ambassador.</p>\n<p>I asked\u00a0her to reflect on those roles, and what the future holds for Central Asian literature in translation. What follows is an abridged transcript of our conversation.</p>\n<p><strong>Filip Noubel: How did you get involved in Central Asian literature and languages, which is a rather rare occurrence among literary translators in the English-speaking world?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong style=\"font-family: ff-tisa-web-pro, sans-serif; background-color: #eeeeee; font-size: 1rem; color: #333333;\">Shelley Fairweather-Vega:\u00a0</strong>It is too rare an occurrence! It was really an accident: the University of Washington, where I did my graduate studies, bundled Central Asian Studies in with Russian Studies. I began studying Uzbek under the guidance of <a href=\"https://jsis.washington.edu/mideast/people/ilse-d-cirtautas/\"><span class=\"s1\">Ilse Cirtautus</span></a>, a legendary scholar and promoter of Uzbek literature. Later the Uzbek writer-in-exile<a href=\"https://www.asymptotejournal.com/blog/2018/07/12/in-conversation-hamid-ismailov/\"><span class=\"s1\"> Hamid Ismailov</span></a>\u00a0convinced me to work on some of his books, and introduced me to other Central Asian writers, which is how I met\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.wordswithoutborders.org/article/january-2018-kazakh-writing-dismissed-zaure-batayeva-s-fairweather-vega?src=intro\"><span class=\"s1\">Zaure Batayeva,</span></a>\u00a0a tireless promoter of Kazakh literature.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">My knowledge of Uzbek isn\u2019t perfect, and my knowledge of Kazakh is scanty, but even the amount I do know is enough to give me a different perspective on translating the literature from that region \u2013 different from translators and readers who work only with Russian.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>FN: Tell us about the books you have recently translated and those that are due to be published. Did you pitch those titles to publishers yourself?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>SFV</strong>: Two of them are by Hamid Ismailov, the ones I agreed to translate back in 2015. \u201cGaia, Queen of Ants\u201d captured the imagination of an editor at Syracuse University Press when I sent it to them.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a fascinating but disturbing tale of exiles trying to find their way in the world: a young man who is traumatised by ethnic conflicts in his childhood, in a country that must be Uzbekistan; an old woman who, it turns out, may have been the instigator of those conflicts; and an Irish woman who escaped the Troubles only to land in the middle of a war zone in Serbia and then a Central Asian prison. As you might expect, it doesn\u2019t end well.</p>\n\n<p>Ismailov\u2019s other novel, \u201cOf Strangers and Bees\u201d, is a homage to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Sufi_literature\">Sufi literary tradition</a> stretching back many centuries. One of its central characters is Avicenna, or Ibn Sino as the Uzbeks call him, who appears as a wandering stranger in different countries and centuries. That means the book is full of different story-telling styles, making it a challenge to translate. That one is coming out from Tilted Axis Press, which also produced Ismailov\u2019s most recent novel in English translation, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/17/the-devils-dance-by-hamid-ismailov-a-landmark-uzbek-novel\">Devils\u2019 Dance</a>.\u201d</p>\n<p>But the next one to come out, on October 1, is a Kazakh novel, \u201cA Life At Noon\u201d, by Talasbek Asemkulov. The author was a scholar of Kazakh history and culture, a musician who played the Kazakh string instrument, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dombra\">dombyra</a>. The novel is a slightly fictionalised retelling of his own life story. He grew up on the stories old men told over tea in the 1960s, and in the book, we all get to hear those stories. It\u2019s unlike anything I\u2019ve ever read before.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>FN: How challenging is it to translate from Central Asian languages and cultures, particularly when it comes to local cultural terms or proverbs?\n</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>SFV\u00a0</strong>I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s more difficult than translating from any other language, although <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_languages\">Turkic languages</a> like Uzbek and Kazakh have a structure extremely different from English. The culture behind those languages is less familiar to English-language readers because we just haven\u2019t read much from that part of the world. Translation is always a strategic balancing act. A translator can alter the whole tone of a story just by choosing how to handle words such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dastarkh%C4%81n\">dastarkhan</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigit\">jigit</a>. Do we explain those words, and if so, how much and how often? Italicise them? Do we leave no comment at all?</p>\n<p>Because Central Asian languages use different alphabets \u2013 sometimes more than one different alphabet \u2013 there\u2019s also the question of spelling. I\u2019ve already mentioned Avicenna and Ibn Sino. And is it jigit or dzhigit? We have to consider at least three aspects when answering those questions. First, how will English-speaking readers pronounce the word, and will that be close to correct? Second, is there a spelling people already know and expect, and is there a good reason to violate those expectations? And third, how Russian is the spelling we\u2019re considering? Because when we call the musical instrument, for example, a dombra, that\u2019s the Russian spelling; Kazakhs pronounce and write it more like dombyra.</p>\n<p>My spelling choices can inadvertently label something a Kazakh or a Russian phenomenon. We can\u2019t avoid the Russian influence and perspective on Central Asia altogether, but we also need to be careful of making the Russian experience there the central, primary, and only lens through which we perceive these stories.</p>\n<p>All these decisions determine how exotic the translated text will seem to the reader and how comfortable or uncomfortable readers might feel experiencing the story. But how comfortable do we <em>want</em> them to feel, anyway? The answer is different for every work, every author, and every publisher.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>FN: How do you think English-speaking audiences and media interpret these literatures?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>SFV:</strong> It might be too soon to tell. Central Asian literature is still an exotic beast, a curiosity. I get the sense that people are more likely to appreciate it for its rareness than for its actual literary merits \u2013 but the art, the stories, are what I like best, and what I hope people will pay attention to. I\u2019d love to move readers away from thinking, \u201chow unusual!\u201d to thinking \u201chow beautiful!\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>FN: Are Central Asian governments or institutions doing enough to promote their countries\u2019 literatures in translation?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>SFV:</strong> We\u2019re seeing more efforts along these lines lately, but still nothing like Russian writers have with the <a href=\"http://institutperevoda.ru/static/225464788/50\">Institut Perevoda</a>\u00a0[a Russian state-sponsored institute for literary translation] and active literary agents. Unfortunately, Central Asian countries have inherited Soviet-style bureaucracies that extend to the literary world and come with opaque rules governing who gets attention. In Kazakhstan, the government decided last year to fund the translation and publication of a volume of poetry and a volume of prose to promote Kazakhstan\u2019s culture abroad. But rather than translators, publishers, and readers, it was mainly bureaucrats who made the decisions about what to include.</p>\n<p>I haven\u2019t heard of any government-led efforts in Uzbekistan. In 2018, I had the privilege of helping to judge a contest for translators of Uzbek literature, and I was excited to see what young Uzbek translators picked to translate. Out of dozens of samples I reviewed, there were only about six authors whose work was represented, all men who wrote in the early decades of the Soviet era. Those stories seem to have been the only ones these young translators thought deserved their attention. If that\u2019s what they\u2019re spending time on, how are readers from outside supposed to discover anything else?</p>\n<p>I\u2019d love to see governments and cultural organisations in Central Asia promoting not just the classics, which do remain too little known in the West, but also exciting new writing by a more diverse group of authors.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>FN: Which authors from Central Asia would you like to recommend to readers, whether translated into English or not?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>SFV</strong>: I\u2019m glad you asked!\u00a0The biggest deal right now is that an English version of a Kazakh historical saga, Rollan Seysenbayev\u2019s \u201cThe Dead Wander in the Desert\u201d<em>,</em>\u00a0is coming out soon, translated by John Farndon and Olga Nakston. Seysenbayev's book addresses some of the same themes that \u201cA Life At Noon\u201d does, though from a different point of view. Furthermore, J. Kates has translated a volume of poetry by Aigerim Tazhi called \u201c<a href=\"https://asianreviewofbooks.com/content/paper-thin-skin-poetry-by-aigerim-tazhi/\">Paper-Thin Skin</a>.\u201d</p>\n<p>Right now I\u2019m working with some less known Kazakh authors who have written amazing things. Zaure Batayeva and I are compiling an anthology of recent short stories by women who write either in Kazakh or Russian. One of those authors, Lilya Kalaus, has a hilarious, touching novel called \u201cThe Last Hope Foundation\u201d about love, ghosts, and the operations of a western non-profit in present-day Central Asia. Kalaus worked with another of those authors, Zira Naurzbayeva, to write a very good pair of children\u2019s adventure stories based on Kazakh myths and legends. And Dastan Kadyrzhanov, following a career in Kazakh politics, has written a novel in free verse about the spiritual crisis in his country after the collapse of the Soviet political system, which is surprisingly funny and erudite.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d love to help them share their insights and their creative work with a wider audience. That\u2019s the best part about being a translator.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/specialcoverage/are-reforms-in-uzbekistan-bringing-real-changes-to-the-people/\">Find out more about changes in Uzbek society here</a></h3>\n</div>", "comments": [{"id": "4748", "news_id": 184, "fallacy": "appeal to tradition", "comment": "In the west I am not sure if we should have more literature from Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan translated.

But not all decided to stay, said the minister in <a href=\"https://agenda.ge/en/news/2022/5102\">an interview</a> in December 2022, with the Georgian media platform Interpressnews. Of those who came, 60,000 stayed, while others used Georgia as a transit point, relocating to other countries. Likely because of this newfound hub status,\u00a0it is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/13/world/europe/georgia-russia-cargo-border.html\">now being reported</a> that the country \u201chas emerged as a convenient logistics conduit between Russia and the outside world.\u201d</p>\n<p>It is not just trucks with goods that are moving through Georgia. Last year, Russian remittances to Georgia <a href=\"https://jam-news.net/record-money-transfers-from-russia/\">reached</a> USD 2 billion in total.

This story is a joint production between The Isaan Record and <a href=\"https://chinadialogue.net/\">China Dialogue</a>.</em></p>\n<p>The future of a Thai-Chinese potash mine planned in northeastern Thailand is mired in uncertainty as villagers are putting up fierce opposition, fueled by concerns about livelihood security, health, and the environment.</p>\n<p>After a protest group led by local women blocked access to drilling sites last year, the Chinese mining company filed a flurry of lawsuits against the villagers seeking 3.6 million baht (about 116,800 USD) in compensation</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, questions linger whether the outgoing military government tweaked legislation to the benefit of foreign mining companies while neglecting environmental protection and community rights.</p>\n<h3><strong>Eying the treasure of the Northeast</strong></h3>\n<p>China\u2019s global success in agricultural production is owed in part to a supply of cheap fertilizers. The country is the world\u2019s largest consumer of potash, a natural mineral that boost yields and enhances crops\u2019 water retention and disease resistance.</p>\n<p>Chinese farmers depend on potash imports mainly from Canada, Russia, and Belarus. But as prices of the mineral remain high with a surge of almost 25 percent in the past year, the country has pushed to develop new and cheaper sources.</p>\n<p>It turned its eyes on the rich potash reserves in Thailand\u2019s Northeast region.</p>\n<p>The region, which has long mined salt, is sitting on two major potash deposits discovered in the 1970s, known as the Khorat Basin and the Sakon Nakhon Basin. Yet in the following decades, the natural resource was left largely unexploited because of strong local opposition, environmental concerns, and legal restrictions.</p>\n<p>After a military junta gained power in a coup in 2014, however, it announced plans to increase mineral resource extraction in the country to boost the economy.</p>\n<p>In the same year, Chinese state-owned China Ming Ta Potash Corporation gained permission to explore 120,000 rai (about 47,500 acres) of land in the northeastern province of Sakon Nakhon. Apichat Sayasiyot, China Ming Ta\u2019s manager said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>China and Thailand are both looking for new potash supply sources to cut import and production costs. Thailand has potash but needs the help of the Chinese to extract it. It\u2019s a Thai-Chinese collaboration that will benefit both parties.</p></blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Local fear and anger</strong></h3>\n<p>In the rural district of Wanon Niwat in Sakon Nakhon province, people responded first with fear, and then with anger to the news of the planned potash mine. Local officials had failed to sufficiently inform the residents of 82 villages that their homes were now part of a mining area.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe company had started exploring at two drilling sites but people in the community were left without any information about the project,\u201d said Mali Saengbunsiri, a 50-year-old farmer and grandmother of four.</p>\n<p>Farming communities in Wanon Niwat depend on the area\u2019s fertile soils, rivers, lakes, and wetlands that form a delicate ecosystem which provides them with food and other resources.</p>\n<p>Many villagers in the district worry that the mining project will destroy farmlands, damage the environment, and poison water sources, as well as imperil people\u2019s health. Mali added:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Just imagine the impact of a huge industrial mining project here. The scary thing about salt is that it is capable of damaging just about everything.</p></blockquote>\n<h3><strong>Poison from below</strong></h3>\n<p>Potash mining produces large amounts of salt as a byproduct that can pose a threat to the area\u2019s soil, water, and animal life. In a region that already suffers from salt-affected soils, locals fear that the project will turn fields into barren land and kill off their crops.</p>\n<p>If the rain washes the salt into rivers, lakes, and wetlands, few freshwater organisms can survive. It could end livelihoods based on fishing in the district\u2019s Huay Thong lake, a body of water that is also the main water source for thousands of people. Mali said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We worry that all the fish will die and the soil will be so salty that we can\u2019t grow any crops on our land anymore.</p>\n<p>We don\u2019t know how the company intends to protect us from the dust and salty water coming from the salt mountain in the mine. How effective is it going to be?</p></blockquote>\n<p>The risk of salt dust being blown by the wind from the mine into closeby communities is raising concerns about the potential impact on people\u2019s health.</p>\n<p>Locals and experts are also concerned that large-scale potash mining will lead to the appearance of dangerous sinkholes. A rock salt operation in a nearby district caused one such hole that grew into a massive, 15-meter-deep pit the size of a football field.</p>\n<p>China Ming Ta seeks to reassure local residents of its safety plans to alleviate these environmental and health risks. It pledges to implement measures to prevent the discharge of dust and salty water into the environment.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Farmers respond with anti-mining protests</strong></h3>\n<p>But the mining company\u2019s assurances come too late to allay the fears of the people of Wanon Niwat. Fueled by the sense that fateful decisions had been made over their heads, villagers in the district organized an anti-mining group in 2016.</p>\n<p>Led mainly by middle-aged and older women, the group has teamed up with activists, academics, and non-governmental organizations to oppose the potash mine. They put up protest banners, organized public forums, and submitted petitions to officials and the company to stop the project.</p>\n<p>In February 2018, the group escalated their protest and blocked the road to the site of the fourth borehole, effectively stopping the company from moving drilling equipment into the area.</p>\n<p>The company plans to set up 60 drilling sites in order to evaluate the quality of the potash before establishing the mine. Earlier, protesters also successfully blocked the site of the planned third borehole. This leaves the company with only two operational drilling sites.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Slapped with lawsuits</strong></h3>\n<p>In response to the local activists\u2019 persistent opposition, the mining company took matters to court and filed a total of 20 lawsuits against nine members of the protest group.</p>\n<p>The company claimed that the blocking of the drilling sites cost it five million baht (about 157,500 USD) each time.</p>\n<p>China Ming Ta accused the villagers of illegal obstruction of their mining site, defamation, and a violation of the Computer Crimes Act for demanding an official investigation into the mining project on social media. The company seeks compensation of 3.6 million baht (about 116,800 USD).</p>\n<p>But Sakkaphon Chaisaengrat, the protesters\u2019 lawyer, argues that the villagers acted well within the law and only exercised their rights.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe law allows people to publicly exercise their community\u2019s rights to protect resources, culture and local ways of life,\u201d he said.</p>\n<h3><strong>A military-drafted mining law</strong></h3>\n<p>Activists and experts in the Northeast argued that local conflicts over natural resource management would likely grow more severe after the Thai government enacted new mining legislation in August 2017 in favour of industry and mining.</p>\n<p>Drafted and approved by the military junta\u2019s appointed lawmakers, the new minerals act fast-tracks the approval process of mining concessions. The consideration period for permits was more than halved from previously 310 days to 100-150 days.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Underestimating local opposition</strong></h3>\n<p>But the junta miscalculated the level of resistance the potash mining project would incite among people of Wanon Niwat and elsewhere.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want industry here!\u201d said Mali. \u201cWe won\u2019t let this area, abundant in natural resources, be turned into an industrial zone.\u201d</p>\n<p>In fact, across the region, local groups have been organizing against mining projects, including in the provinces of Nakhon Ratchasima, Chaiyaphum, Loei and Udon Thani.</p>\n</div>", "comments": [{"id": "7833", "news_id": 612, "fallacy": "appeal to nature", "comment": "I believe that the concerns of mining by the citizens of rural Thailand is sensible and valid.

Home to numerous species of marine life (and a main source of fish for local fishermen), they also protect the coastline from wave erosion and the effects of tropical storms. Popular spots like <a href=\"http://www.buccoo.net/seaside/buccoo-reef\">Buccoo Reef</a> are also popular tourist attractions.</p>\n<p>But after a <a href=\"https://www.ima.gov.tt/2019/08/22/coral-bleaching-outlook-for-trinidad-and-tobago/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a> issued by the country's Institute of Marine Affairs (IMA) on August 22, 2019, in which it warned that \u2014 based on findings from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) <a href=\"https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/satellite/index.php\">Coral Reef Watch</a> \u2014 Tobago's coral reefs have been placed on a watch for \u201cBleaching Alert Level One\u201d, all eyes are on the island. There is a distinct possibility that the bleaching could advance to Level Two within a matter of weeks, which would threatens not only the existence of the reefs themselves, but also the island's marine life and people.</p>\n<h3>What exactly is bleaching?</h3>\n<p>Corals coexist with and become home to symbiotic algae, helping it store nutrients and remove waste.\u00a0In return, the algae gives the coral the energy it needs to grow, but drastic changes in water temperature can threaten this cooperative relationship.</p>\n<p>When water becomes too hot (or too cold) the corals expel the algae \u2014 and with it, its main source of food. Eventually, the coral starves to death; the most noticeable outward sign of this phenomenon is that the coral loses its colour, going from\u00a0shades of brown and green to a crisp, brittle, bone white.</p>\n<p>Bleaching Level Alert One means that the corals are extremely likely to start the bleaching process. The IMA therefore suggests that both biologists and citizens should <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.tt/news/ima-wants-citizens-help-in-fighting-coral-bleaching-6.2.918013.36f444bf0f\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">keep an eye out</a> for signs of bleaching over the next 9-12 weeks.</p>\n<p>Level Two bleaching would be an indication of widespread coral bleaching and coral mortality.</p>\n<h3>What causes it?</h3>\n<p>According to local coral reef ecologist<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnjGanase\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Anjani Ganase</a>, the main contributors to coral bleaching in Tobago are the warmer water temperatures \u2014 a result of climate change.</p>\n<p>Via email, Ganase explained that the ocean absorbs much of the heat in the atmosphere, which in turn causes the water \u2014 especially shallower bodies of water, like the Caribbean Sea \u2014 to heat up.</p>\n<p>In fact, NOAA's 12-week outlook extends well past Tobago to the reefs of the Lesser Antilles. Other reefs around the region, most notably in parts of the Greater Antilles and Cuba, have already been placed on a Level Two Bleaching Alert:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">This makes me so sad.

Because reefs provide fishes with a habitat that allows them to have access to shelter, food and most importantly, <a href=\"https://www.qm.qld.gov.au/microsites/biodiscovery/05human-impact/importance-of-coral-reefs.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">shelter for their young</a> until they are ready to survive in the wider ocean, the proposition of losing them will impact the ability of fish species to survive. It will also negatively affect the livelihoods of local fishermen.</p>\n<p>Tobago relies very heavily on its local tourism industry; its reefs reportedly attract around <a href=\"https://sta.uwi.edu/uwitoday/archive/july_2018/article11.asp\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">40 per cent of the island's tourists</a>. Should coral bleaching continue, there will be fewer thriving reefs for people to explore and quite likely, a reduction in tourism dollars, which affects a range of hospitality-related industries: hotels, restaurants, transport services and tour companies.</p>\n<p>The great irony is that, as tropical storms intensify as a result of the climate crisis, reefs are needed more than ever to <a href=\"https://www.qm.qld.gov.au/microsites/biodiscovery/05human-impact/importance-of-coral-reefs.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">absorb the force</a> of waves and create a buffer between the ocean and the shore \u2014 but the reefs are compromised by global heating.</p>\n<p>Studies show that coral reefs protect\u00a0around <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/resources/maps/shoreline-protection-coral-reefs-tobago\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">90 per cent of Tobago's shoreline</a> from wave-induced erosion.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://sta.uwi.edu/uwitoday/archive/july_2018/article11.asp\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">feature address</a> at the International Year of the Reef at the University of the West Indies in 2018, Professor John Agard said that this function will only become more important as storm intensities increase and sea levels rise.</p>\n<h3>What can we do to stop it?</h3>\n<p>Ganase says the lack of proper management that has allowed overfishing and pollution to go unchecked has made Tobago's coral bleaching worse. If this continues, she explains, active\u00a0management and protection will be critical for full recovery and growth:</p>\n<blockquote><p><span id=\"E139\">Ideally,</span><span id=\"E140\"> coral reefs </span><span id=\"E142\">should be closed</span><span id=\"E145\">to the public and placed in</span><span id=\"E146\">to</span><span id=\"E148\">an</span><span id=\"E149\"> intensive </span><span id=\"E150\">recovery programme</span><span id=\"E151\"> to ensure </span><span id=\"E152\">hea</span><span id=\"E153\">l</span><span id=\"E154\">thy</span><span id=\"E155\"> fish communities and water quality that will</span><span id=\"E156\"> suppor</span><span id=\"E157\">t</span><span id=\"E158\"> coral growth and recruitment.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>She added:</p>\n<blockquote><p><span id=\"E315\">I</span><span id=\"E316\">ndividual action</span><span id=\"E317\">s</span><span id=\"E318\"> to </span><span id=\"E319\">reduce our carbon footprint</span><span id=\"E322\">are</span><span id=\"E323\">\u00a0are always </span><span id=\"E324\">warranted</span><span id=\"E326\"> but </span><span id=\"E327\">we also need citizens to </span><span id=\"E328\">demand more action\u00a0</span><span id=\"E330\">from our\u00a0</span><span id=\"E332\">government</span><span id=\"E333\">s\u00a0</span><span id=\"E335\">to </span><span id=\"E336\">provide the infrastructure, resources and education f</span><span id=\"E337\">or climate </span><span id=\"E338\">conservation and </span><span id=\"E339\">adaptation.\u00a0</span><span id=\"E340\">Communities need the support</span><span id=\"E341\"> to manage and conserve our natural resources\u00a0</span><span id=\"E343\">not just from governments </span><span id=\"E345\">but</span><span id=\"E347\"> from business</span><span id=\"E348\">es</span><span id=\"E349\"> and corporations</span><span id=\"E350\"> that also utilise these resources.\u00a0</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>There is a pressing need for regional island governments to demand an international effort in tackling the climate crisis.\u00a0On September 11, 2019, Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley <a href=\"https://unctad.org/en/pages/newsdetails.aspx?OriginalVersionID=2187\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">addressed</a> this issue at the United Nations\u2019 Geneva headquarters, urging larger nations to do better in fighting climate change.

According to a <a href=\"https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/kamerstukken/2020/09/14/kamerbrief-over-financiele-prikkels-voor-fossiele-brandstoffen-in-nederland\">letter</a>\u00a0by Eric Wiebes, the former Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy, these subsidies amount to 4.5 billion Euros. However,\u00a0<a href=\"https://milieudefensie.nl/over-ons\">Milleaudefensie</a>, a Dutch environmental NGO, found that the volume of financial aid flowing from the Dutch government to fossil fuels is much higher. In a <a href=\"https://milieudefensie.nl/actueel/absurd-nederland-steunt-grote-vervuilers-met-8-miljard-euro-per-jaar\">study</a> published in July 2020, they claim that \u201cthe government sponsors large polluting companies with 8.3 billion euros per year.\u201d Both Milleaudefensie and XRNL claim that this funding runs contrary to the Dutch government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.caneurope.org/docman/fossil-fuel-subsidies-1/3179-netherlands-brief-phase-out-2020-monitoring-europe-s-fossil-fuel-subsidies-pdf/file\">promise</a> to stop subsidizing fossil fuels by 2020.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Shell energy company is also gaining particular attention. The \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ftm.nl/dossier/shell-papers\">Shell Papers</a>\u201d is a joint project between journalists from the Platform for Authentic Journalism (PAJ) and Follow the Money (FTM) who are currently investigating ties between the Dutch government and the British-Dutch\u00a0multinational oil and gas company. Shell is one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/09/revealed-20-firms-third-carbon-emissions\">most polluting companies</a> in the world.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">PAJ has filed 17 <a href=\"https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/wet-openbaarheid-van-bestuur-wob/vraag-en-antwoord/hoe-dien-ik-een-wob-verzoek-in\">lawful requests</a> to several government bodies demanding the release of \u201call documents\u2014such as e-mails, memos, policy documents, and even WhatsApp messages\u2014since 2005 that originate from, are directed to, or are about Shell.\u201d According to a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.ftm.nl/artikelen/gemeente-assen-willigt-wob-verzoek-shell-papers-in?share=p6ZlQT3wDA%2BQ9std1SNCI0SmFG4UcS1qsjQxPCoXYZAhDYeagCvhl3s6QBr%2BlDE%3D\">story</a>\u00a0by the PAJ, only the municipality of Assen has complied with the request so far, despite the municipalityreceiving legal pressure from the Economy and Climate Ministry.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Unlike Germany and Italy, the Dutch \u201cgovernment does not publish an inventory of its fossil fuel subsidies, nor of its environmentally harmful subsidies,\u201d a 2017 <a href=\"https://www.caneurope.org/docman/fossil-fuel-subsidies-1/3179-netherlands-brief-phase-out-2020-monitoring-europe-s-fossil-fuel-subsidies-pdf/file\">report</a> by Laurie van der Burg and Matthias Runkel reports.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Therefore, in addition to a plea for meaningful climate action, the protest was also a call for government transparency regarding the use of public funds and the state's connections to Shell and the wider fossil fuel industry.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"nl\">Er is permanent een <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Shell?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@shell</a> medewerker gestationeerd op het ministerie van EKZ Zaken.

A version of the article is republished below as part of a content-sharing agreement.</em></p>\n<p><strong>By Ronald Taylor</strong></p>\n<p>Tasked with the responsibility of providing information and analysis on current affairs to keep the public informed, media practitioners are commonly called society\u2019s eyes and ears. So, when it comes to the climate crisis, Caribbean journalists have committed to providing adequate coverage of an issue that is intricately linked to the region\u2019s stability and well-being.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2021/11/13/antigua-and-barbuda-says-polluters-must-pay-as-climate-change-remains-existential-threat-to-small-island-developing-states/\">Small Island Developing States</a> (SIDS), the Caribbean is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, which include <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2014/06/06/the-caribbean-raises-its-voice-for-world-environment-day/\">rising sea levels</a>, more frequent and <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2017/09/20/we-dare-not-look-out-dominica-is-brutalised-by-hurricane-maria/\">intense tropical cyclones</a>, and prolonged <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2023/03/19/the-threat-of-bush-fires-in-the-caribbean-is-a-hot-button-issue/\">droughts</a>. Despite being one of the world\u2019s regions most vulnerable to climate change, the Caribbean\u2019s contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2021/11/01/caribbean-negotiators-should-seek-solutions-and-support-at-cop26/\">minuscule</a>, putting the region in the position of experiencing the worst impacts of climate change without having caused them.</p>\n<p>The predicament has led to <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2021/12/05/post-cop26-a-caribbean-view-on-climate-injustice-and-1-5-to-stay-alive/\">growing calls</a> for climate justice, which aims to <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2022/11/12/loss-and-damage-in-the-caribbean-we-see-it-we-feel-it-we-know-it/\">address</a> the unequal distribution of the costs and benefits of climate change mitigation and adaptation.</p>\n<p>For their part, Caribbean journalists are finding it essential to report on these issues, and ensure those who play a greater role in causing climate change are held accountable. Their work also strives to amplify the voices of those most affected, and provide a platform for them to demand climate justice.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/10/1129162\">According to UNESCO</a>, \u201cthree of the media\u2019s traditional roles \u2014 informing audiences, acting as watchdogs, and campaigning on social issues \u2014 are especially relevant in the context of a changing climate.\u201d</p>\n<p>A few regional journalists shared their perspectives on the issue; here are some of the best takeaways:</p>\n\n<h3>\u2018The media controls the narrative\u2019</h3>\n<p>For more than five years now, Guyanese television reporter O\u2019nielka Bacchus, who also holds a BSc in environmental studies, has been doing stories that show citizens how critical it is for them to be aware of climate change issues: \u201cIf people do not understand the value of environmental education, then why would they appreciate it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Noting that \u201cThe media controls narrative,\u201d she explained: \u201cIt can influence people, it can educate people and the more information is put out there, the more people become aware of certain issues.\u201d</p>\n<p>One of the most challenging aspects of reporting in Guyana, Bacchus says, is accessing data from both government institutions and private organisations, which can be a setback, especially when doing environmental reporting. While environmental activists are usually available for interviews, balanced reporting also requires current statistics from government organisations.</p>\n<h3>Journalists must \u2018connect the dots\u2019</h3>\n\n<p>Belizean journalist Andr\u00e9 Habet says it's up to journalists to clearly connect the dots of climate change in order for people to understand the scope of the crisis.</p>\n<p>Noting that issues around climate change are often difficult for people who are not already involved in environmental work to understand, he believes journalists must \u201cclarify those connections and demonstrate how enmeshed people and the environment are, especially in the case of stories on pro-capital projects that promise to boost economic well-being in exchange for environmental degradation.\u201d</p>\n<p>By producing comprehensive stories, Habet added, \u201cPublications and journalists both expand their sense of what a climate justice story is \u2014 [it] doesn\u2019t always have to be about a clear battle between communities and governments or corporations, but about more nuanced shifts in communities that may not be perceptible in a singular moment.\u201d</p>\n\n<h3>\u2018Imperative\u2019 to identify those responsible for environmental degradation</h3>\n<p>Elvira Hernandez, a multimedia journalist from the Dominican Republic, says that when it comes to reporting on the climate crisis, \u201cIt is necessary to identify the most felt needs of society,\u201d since climate justice is essential to the critical landscape in which we live.</p>\n<p>\u201cIt seeks due respect for the rights of environmental activists and redress for the most vulnerable countries for climate wrongs committed by more developed nations,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is therefore imperative to address the climate crisis by identifying those responsible for environmental degradation.\u201d</p>\n<h3>Not enough environmental coverage in the region</h3>\n\n<p>Saying \u201cIt is not a topic that we as reporters dedicate attention to or focus on,\u201d Guyanese journalist David Papannah believes there is a need for more reporting on climate issues throughout the Caribbean.</p>\n<p>In his opinion, environmental reporting has only touched the surface and he would like to see more training opportunities for Caribbean journalists in specialised areas like climate education, suggesting that regional media associations, as well as environmental organisations and line ministries, can play an important role.</p>\n<h3>Marginalised communities are disproportionately affected</h3>\n\n<p>In describing her experience reporting on climate change, Surinamese journalist Priscilla Misiekaba-Kia notes that \u201cthe unequal distribution of climate burdens and resources \u2014 within and between countries and social groups \u2014 is not easily visible.\u201d</p>\n<p>As a result, she thinks it is important to investigate how marginalised communities are often disproportionately affected by natural hazards like pollution and natural disasters. In some cases, there is also the unequal distribution of emergency aid from governments and humanitarian institutions.</p>\n<p>In spelling out the disparities of the climate crisis, Misiekaba-Kia says that through reporters using their platforms to share information, marginalised communities can improve their resilience and disaster preparedness: \u201c[Journalists] should explain [that] the climate crisis is urgent and requires immediate action.

The river has <a href=\"https://www.thetimesoftruth.com/how-flooding-shifted-a-village-in-assams-dhemaji/\">shifted course</a> by as much as three kilometers since 1960, and stories like these are not standalone but, rather, scattered across the length and breadth of Assam.

The village of <a href=\"https://www.thethirdpole.net/en/climate/brahin-assam-village-committees-lead-the-way-during-floods/\">Chomoni Chapori</a> also has a disaster management committee, with volunteers catering to the needs of not just their own community, but also those of nearby villages \u2014 and these citizen-based initiatives are both logical and systematic in their approach.

When it comes to predicting the ways of rivers, rains and floods, observations of elders based on their traditional experiences and folk beliefs are still <a href=\"https://indiaclimatedialogue.net/2018/10/05/traditional-agricultural-wisdom-still-relevant-in-assam/\">considered</a> credible early warning systems in many villages, even when most villagers today have access to smartphones and weather applications.</p>\n<p>Udhab Borah, 28, was among the first to begin using smartphones in his home village of Sumoni Chapori in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorhat\">Jorhat</a> district, about five years ago. This gave him access to various weather applications. \u201cThough I do browse through their different forecasts on my mobile phone, or pause to hear the announcements made over radio and television, I still think that my village elders are almost 80 percent correct, in their weather predictions,\u201d he says.</p>\n<h3>Nature\u2019s signals for weather alerts</h3>\n<p>The village elders from Sumoni Chapori \u2014 Narayan Neog, Gajan Borah and Pradeep Neog \u2014 are known for accurately predicting impending rains, floods or cyclones. According to them, nature sends out her own signals to alert us about the upcoming calamities.</p>\n<p><em>\u201cAme baan, kothale dhaan\u201d</em>, goes a popular adage in the village, says Narayan. Translated it means that mango flowers blooming in abundance herald floods for the year. While bountiful <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackfruit\">jackfruits</a> appearing in the trees indicate a good paddy harvest ahead (lesser chances of floods).</p>\n<p>\u201cAnimals around us are much quicker to sense the changing weather conditions and often behave in out of ordinary or erratic ways,\u201d says Gajan. Years of observing some of these behavioural changes help them to predict the approaching natural calamities. He explains that if cows for instance suddenly become restless, start running hither and thither and go out of control, it is a sign of imminent rains and floods.</p>\n<p>Pradeep further explains a popular folk belief based on the behaviour of cows at dawn, during their auspicious occasion of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihu\">Goru Bihu</a> (a festival dedicated to the care and worship of livestock). The head of the family enters the cowshed at the crack of dawn, to offer obeisance to the cows. If he finds the cows standing or restless, it is a sign that there will be a flood that year.</p>\n<p>Worse still if there are dark (black) cows that are uneasy and jittery, this indicates the floods may be more severe than normal. However, on rare occasions, if the cows are found sleeping or even lying on the ground, it is time to rejoice, as it means there would be no floods that year.</p>\n<p>But with the vagaries and impacts of climate change becoming more and more unpredictable, they admit that even the behaviour of the animals is becoming somewhat unreliable.</p>\n<p>The villagers further believe that if the water level of the river <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmaputra_River\">Brahmaputra</a> rises on a particular day of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambubachi_Mela\">Ambubachi</a> (another sacred occasion falling in the month of June, observed statewide), there would be floods for the rest of the year. On the other hand, if the river does not rise on that day, the floods would be less serious.</p>\n\n<p>According to them, the uninterrupted croaking of frogs or the sudden appearance of trails of small ants in the soil also warns of heavy rain and floods. Further, if the water bodies are found to have no fish or less fish during the early part of the rainy season (April\u2013May), there could be floods in that year.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe behaviour of the rarely seen vultures also help us to forecast storms and cyclones,\u201d says Rajib Morang, from Majdolopa village of Golaghat district. Vultures are known to build nests on top of tall trees, he explains. They can perhaps sense the approach of cyclones in advance and accordingly choose trees in safe locations to build their nests. So, easily spotting their nests indicates lower chances of cyclones.</p>\n<h3>Distant mountains and weather warnings</h3>\n<p>Rajib further points out thick dark grey clouds blanketing the sun and the sky, shrouding the horizon and distant hills are warnings enough that there is heavy rain on the upper reaches of the neighbouring states of Arunachal or Nagaland.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe further observe the direction of the wind, the height of clouds, and their proximity to the mountains. These give us an idea on the state of rains and that of floodwater in the higher ranges,\u201d he says. Accordingly, they are able to estimate the time within which the rainwater would tumble down the hills and flood the villages.</p>\n<p>Community members dwelling on the hills also warn them when they experience heavy rains that might lead to flooding. \u201cNormally we get about 24\u201336 hours in hand and this helps us to decide in advance the preparatory measures to be adopted \u2014 whether we can cope with it from our homes or would have to rush out with our essentials and cattle to higher lands near embankments,\u201d he says.</p>\n<h3>Methods of preservation</h3>\n<p>These folk beliefs have been passed on as oral traditions among the villagers for generations. However, in an effort to preserve them, some enthusiastic educated youths in certain villages are also documenting them. Non-profits such as <a href=\"https://baliparafoundation.com/\">Balipara Foundation</a> are interviewing and video recording the village elders to preserve their folk beliefs and traditional knowledge.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe may find it difficult to establish these beliefs scientifically, yet they are found to be at least 75 percent to 80 percent correct\u201d, says <a href=\"https://www.gauhati.ac.in/member/ratul-mahanta?aid=Mg==&amp;did=MTc=\">Ratul Mahanta</a>, Professor in Economics from Gauhati University, working on climate issues with indigenous communities. According to him, these local communities have been living on the banks of the River Brahmaputra for generations. While co-existing with the local ecosystem and biodiversity, they have been observing the behaviour of the flora and fauna and accordingly adapting to the changing natural phenomena.</p>\n<p>\u201cAll these aspects put together have shaped their local customs, indigenous knowledge and traditional wisdom, which enable them to predict the upcoming weather with a fair amount of accuracy,\u201d he says. Most importantly the predictions of elders according to him help their fellow community members to prepare themselves in advance for the approaching weather disturbances.</p>\n<div class=\"notes\">Note: The research and reporting for the story were supported by the National Geographic Society, as a part of a storytelling grant on climate impacts in the Himalayan region.</div>\n</div>", "comments": [{"id": "3640", "news_id": 64, "fallacy": "none", "comment": "Climate change is a serious issue that needs to be addressed in Assam before its too late.

India is now the world\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cnbctv18.com/buzz/looking-for-love-dating-apps-cash-in-on-85-million-young-and-single-indians-3306141.htm\">fourth-largest user of online dating apps</a>. However, despite the developing social and sexual landscape, attitudes in the medical profession on sexual issues, even in India\u2019s largest cities, are still enmeshed with conservative thinking.</p>\n<p>Over the last four years, a campaign called Health Over Stigma ran by Delhi-based youth organization Haiyya, has been challenging this system by linking unmarried women with sexual health and reproductive services \u2014 and changing the views of India\u2019s gynecologists.</p>\n<p>In February 2020, I met with Sreejani Malakar, the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.haiyya.in/our-works/health-over-stigma/\">Health Over Stigma</a>\u00a0campaign manager, who explained:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you are sexually active, the precondition is that you are married. If you are not married, and having sexual relationships, you are considered impure and the doctor will not treat you. It is a social stigma; doctors and medical professionals are products of the social system. And the level of shame involved is so great that women often cannot bring themselves to seek the services they need.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Traditionally, in Hinduism, sex before marriage is seen as a <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/23620149?seq=1\">source of pollution</a>, and stigmatized outside of marriage; in Islam, it is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z8kjpv4/revision/4#\">forbidden</a>. These attitudes among doctors, Malakar says, lead unmarried women to de-prioritize their sexual health needs and refrain from accessing the appropriate services.</p>\n<p>In a survey of unmarried women living in Delhi, conducted throughout 2018, Haiyya found only <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kr9BY0UQQy_uENokv2omqFpec6WHMJre/view\">5 percent of respondents</a> took their information about sex or contraception from medical professionals. Most, they found, relied on the internet or friends.</p>\n<p>Other statistics reveal the consequence of this vacuum. The same survey discovered that only 20 percent of the women surveyed understood their rights relating to abortion. Meanwhile, a\u00a0<a href=\"https://in.yougov.com/en-hi/news/2018/09/26/condom-most-used-form-contraception-urban-youth/\">2018 YouGov India survey</a> revealed that 15 percent of women thought that emergency contraception was not suitable as a regular method of contraception; 49 percent were not sure.</p>\n<h3><strong>\u2018The man at the pharmacy pretends to mishear me\u2019</strong></h3>\n<p>Sapna Devi (not her real name), a young, unmarried woman, shared her experience with me last February in an interview in her home city of Jaipur. \u201cI was 18 when I met my last boyfriend on Facebook. We dated for two years, and would meet in hotels, where no-one could see us,\u201d she recounted.</p>\n<p>Sapna described how the first gynecologist refused to treat her as an unmarried woman. She tried again, this time pretending to be engaged, and managed to receive the contraceptive injection. She bled irregularly in the following months, but felt she couldn\u2019t go back to the doctor. In the end, she resorted back to condoms and emergency contraception.</p>\n<p>At 1.50 USD per dose, the emergency contraceptive pill is by far one of the most accessible options of contraception for women in India, with one pre-pandemic survey finding <a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/cover-story/story/20111205-sex-survey-2011-sex-condom-kama-sutra-relationship-safe-sex-749789-2011-11-24#ssologin=1\">77 percent of single women</a> use it as a regular means of contraception, despite the uncertainties over the side-effects of long-term usage.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe man at the pharmacy always pretends to mishear me, making me ask twice. But I don\u2019t care; it is the easiest option,\u201d said Devi.</p>\n<h3>Building networks</h3>\n<p>It was stories like Devi's that pushed Haiyya to start the <a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/mail-today/story/delhi-health-over-stigma-haiyya-sexual-health-972877-2017-04-22\">Heath over Stigma</a>\u00a0campaign back in 2017.</p>\n<p>At that time, Haiyya ran a set of meet-ups called the \u201c<a href=\"http://aagaaztheatre.org/things-people-say/vagina-dialogues-with-haiyya/\">Vagina Dialogues\u201d</a>, where unmarried women were encouraged to talk about their sexual health experiences. The dialogues revealed the extent of the problem and Haiyya decided to scale up the movement by going to the streets and asking women to share their stories.</p>\n<p>Haiyya has found, for example, that many doctors refuse to perform internal examinations on unmarried women; requests for safe contraception are rejected; and those needing abortions are referred to expensive, often illegal, clinics, despite terminations being legal in India up to 20 weeks, regardless of marital status.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1016/S0968-8080%2804%2924012-5\">Low public provision and failure to regulate private providers</a> mean abortion charges, particularly for the unmarried, are beyond the spending power of most patients.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/mygynaecstory?f=live\">#MyGynaecStory</a>, the campaign\u2019s hashtag, features the testimonies highlighting some of the grave consequences \u2014 both physical and mental \u2014 of a healthcare system shaped by a highly sexually conservative society.</p>\n<p>Writer, singer and feminist Asmita tweeted in 2019:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Going to the gynaec as an unmarried woman is already an v stressful experience.

She spoke to me by phone from Delhi:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Prior to this, I used to judge every unmarried girl I treated, and I am not even that old, I\u2019m only in my early 30s. But that type of societal thinking, it is engrained. We tend to think in one way, whatever we have been taught, whatever we have been seeing around us. But until someone comes and makes us aware of the necessity of this issue, the issue is not going to be taken up, no one is going to give it even a second thought.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The campaign then devised <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gmYEnZVdbnjvOsMkYbb37QIMzoPru0ih/view\">a set of minimum standards</a> for doctors when treating women for gynecological issues. These \u201c10 commandments\u201d include rules such as maintaining the confidentiality and treating female patients as independent entities, necessary as doctors often seek the permission of a husband before treatment.</p>\n<p>In an important victory for the campaign, these standards were <a href=\"http://www.haiyya.in/updates-stigma/media-release-dmc-dma-commit-to-providing-safe-non-judgmental-sexual-health-services-to-unmarried-women-in-new-delhi/\">adopted by two medical councils</a>\u00a0in 2019, including the Delhi Medical Council, one of the largest medical associations in Delhi.</p>\n<p>In the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic, accessing sexual health services has never been harder for unmarried women in India, and Health Over Stigma has moved online as it attempts to maximize its reach. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/healthoverstigma/\">Instagram</a> is the main vehicle of communication where the campaign has been sharing contacts of amenable gynecologists, and arranging \u201caccess days,\u201d when women can discuss sexual health concerns online with doctors.</p>\n</div>", "comments": [{"id": "5805", "news_id": 336, "fallacy": "appeal to tradition", "comment": "Asian society is predominantly conservative.

If, for example, one of the parents dies and the child does not share the surviving parent's last name, that parent <a href=\"https://es.globalvoices.org/2014/12/16/asesinato-de-activista-por-matrimonio-igualitario-en-venezuela-evidencia-consecuencias-de-la-desigualdad-legal/\">loses all parental rights</a> to the child as they are not legally registered as parent and child.

Thus, from the editors of the <a href=\"https://www.andes.info.ec/es/noticias/sociedad/17/satya-nacio-en-malchingui\">website Andes</a>, the decision of the court is significant:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">Es, adem\u00e1s, una forma de reconocer una situaci\u00f3n social que se da de hecho y cuyo desconocimiento oficial no hace sino llevar a ni\u00f1os, ni\u00f1as y adolescentes que se cr\u00edan en familias no convencionales a no gozar de la protecci\u00f3n que deben proveer el Estado, la sociedad y la familia para lograr su desarrollo integral.\u00a0 </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"translation\"><p>It is, furthermore, a way of recognizing a social situation that does, in fact, occur, in which ignorant officials do nothing but take away boys, girls, and teenagers who are raised in non-conventional households where they do not experience the protection they should from the sate, society, or family to achieve their full development.</p></blockquote>\n<p class=\"p2\">Other analysts who\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GKcityec/status/1006330258788843521\">study the Satya case</a>\u00a0argue that its relevance has yet to be seen:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"es\">El <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/casoSatya?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#casoSatya</a> tiene una importancia que a\u00fan no logramos dimensionar.

Here we put it in context.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Only the beginning</h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">It appears that the court's ruling would be solely for this case, and the National Assembly will have one year to create new legislation surrounding this loophole. For now, <a href=\"https://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/noticias/judicial/12/corte-constitucional-sentencia-satya-sanciones-disculpas\">public apologies from the Civil Registry</a>\u00a0as expected, as well as sanctions to the workers who refused to register Satya. Those following the case expect that the legislative body would use the ruling of the Satya case as a guide to set a new standard to be recognized for the country's constitution, the right to identity, equality in front of the law, and the main points of interest of the case: the rights of children who are part of same-sex parent families.</p>\n<p>Beginning with a <a href=\"https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refer%C3%A9ndum_constitucional_de_Ecuador_de_2008\">constitutional referendum in 2008</a>, the legal framework for members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) community in Ecuador has expanded over the last several years. That reform recognized diverse families in a broad sense, the difference between identity and sexual orientation, and universal civil unions, amongst other things.</p>\n<p>Still, after a decade with the new Ecuadorian constitution in place, societal norms still exist that discriminate against members of the LGBTI community and keep them from exercising their rights, making them less visible.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfyylYgtAT8&amp;t=86s\">short documentary</a>\u00a0titled \u201cSatya: The Case of Helen and Nicola\u201d sheds light on the complexity of the debate. LGBTI rights activists, human rights defenders, and representatives of groups that are against recognizing Satya as a girl with two mothers participated in the making of the film.</p>\n<p>In the case of the latter, they say the reason for their opposition is not because of religious reasons, but \u201canthropological reasons\u201d: they seek to defend the \u201crespect of the laws of nature\u201d and the \u201cbalance\u201d that comes from the education given by families made by a man and a woman.</p>\n\n<p>Human rights defenders, on the other hand, argue the importance of looking to other cases in the past, like women's vote \u2014 which for many was unthinkable less than a century ago \u2014 and collective social advances. They aspire for Ecuador to join the global trend in which equality is becoming the norm through the formal recognition of the rights of all people, especially those not acknowledged in patriarchal or heteronormative societies, and whose rights could be threatened by the law.</p>\n<p>Danilo Marzano, a member of the LGBTI community who was interviewed for the documentary during one of the rallies to support Satya, Nicola, and Helen, said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cEn realidad hoy m\u00e1s que un deseo personal es un deseo colectivo.

Peter is also known for <a href=\"http://talanoa.com.au/peter-sipeli_page/\">conducting</a> spoken word sessions to highlight the experience of LGBTQ+ individuals in Fiji.</p>\n<p>In an email interview with this author, Peter shared how art is integral to advocacy, talks about the challenges that artists and activists face in Fiji, and highlights the need to rethink how advocacies are conceptualized in the Oceania region.</p>\n<p>Peter observed how development issues are framed in many ways that do not totally capture the lived experiences of Pacific Islanders. Peter said colonialism is partly to blame for discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think the problem we face in Fiji and generally across the Pacific is that the unjust laws that govern the lives of LGBTQ+ people are archaic and the ones created by the British that our people after independence have inherited; and that all these are not only reflected in our laws, but in Christian ideals as well that pervade and blur cultural ideas, and so we are left working to remind our peoples that before \u2018contact\u2019 we were quite sexually diverse and sexuality was very fluid.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Peter noted that colonial legacy has prevented Pacific peoples from interacting with each other:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think the problem even we in the Pacific face is that we are so busy looking down working in our own burrows that we don\u2019t look up to see other people in the Pacific, in Asia, across the world in Africa and beyond. There need to be newer ways of seeing that allows us to look at creative work being used for societal change so we can not only know but to learn from each other.</p>\n<p>Too often the utterance that we hear in the Pacific, is \u2018Asia, Pacific region\u2019 and Asia is so large that they cannot even see us. The Pacific is broken up in three parts, parts that the colonizers created 1) French Pacific \u2013 that is locked from us because of language 2) the North Pacific, that was colonized by the Americans, we are unable to see them because of geographic location \u2026 they\u2019re so far north, we know a little about their nuclear history and us 3) the Anglo pacific and we all work in isolation from each other\u2026 there are political and trade relations but the people are divorced from each other.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To remedy this, Peter tapped into the arts to create \u201ca newer and more human conversation about rights, about pain and how we Pacific Island people are able to work to repair the rift that was caused by the colonizers.\u201d Peter adds:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The idea behind \u2018storytelling for advocacy\u2019 is about remembering. In the Pacific, if you speak truth and do so with power and with resonance about a lived experience, and the levels of fracture of that experience and indicate to different audiences this reality, people understand, people are awakened to our needs and our work for equal rights.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Peter discussed how storytelling, instead of merely relying on legislative lobbying, became an effective approach to advocate for LGBTQ+ rights:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Too often the rights conversation is a linear one that talks about only one aspect of gaining equality, about advocating for rights, through this movement towards legislature and policy shift. I wanted to create a human conversation about the pain that we endure, that ostracization, and unpack that for people to see into. I also allow the talk to delve into scripture and to look deeply at the parts of the Bible that speak against homosexuality and to demystify these aspects for the audience, to again create a conversation about the biblical text and find kinder ways of caring for people.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Peter said storytelling proved \u2018transformative\u2019 in the sessions they conducted with the Fiji Women\u2019s Crisis Center and even with members of the military and police.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think my work through poetry and through the storytelling for advocacy is finding new ways of having a conversation about creating kinder communities for LGBTQ+ people.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Finally, Peter emphasized the need to develop a \u2018new way of seeing\u2019 in the Pacific:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think we need all collectively to find a new way of \u2018seeing\u2019 so we might appreciate, learn and thus become humanly connected to each other in a deeper way that can overcome meaningless utterances.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Watch Peter's TEDx talk about \u2018storytelling as advocacy\u2019 through this YouTube video</p>\n\n</div>", "comments": [{"id": "3850", "news_id": 134, "fallacy": "appeal to majority", "comment": "From my understanding, most of the people in these area's aren't particularly for LGBTQ people.

She has long been advocating for the right of women to participate in municipal elections and to drive, and was one of the first women to drive the day the ban was lifted.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Following the arrests of al-Yousef, al-Nafjan and al-Hathloul and three other activists in May, official statements circulated in state media, accusing all three women of\u00a0posing a threat to state security for their contact with foreign entities \u201cwith the aim of undermining the country\u2019s stability and social fabric\u201d, Amnesty <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/05/saudi-arabia-chilling-smear-campaign-tries-to-discredit-loujain-al-hathloul-and-other-detained-womens-rights-defenders/\">reported</a>.

Like Badawi, Al-Sadah also campaigned for women\u2019s rights and she was previously interrogated over her human rights activism. In the 2015 municipal elections, during which women were allowed to vote and participate for the first time, Al-Sadah decided to run.

After a few days, government authorities <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/amharic/news-53364760\"><span class=\"s2\">charged</span></a> an alleged assassin along with two other accomplices.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In the wake of his murder, the country has struggled to come to terms with the violence that followed. The truth of Hachalu's assassination is not yet fully clear, and in its aftermath, speculation began to fly as politicians and activists<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1jS_78YR_c\"><span class=\"s2\"> stoked</span></a> long-standing tensions between Oromo and Amahara elites, two of Ethiopia's largest ethnic groups.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That day, mourners flooded the streets of Addis Ababa and cities and towns across Oromia state. The next morning, Oromia Media Network (OMN), a satellite TV station on which Hachalu had his last contentious<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERAHOGwogCg&amp;t=2350s\"><span class=\"s2\"> interview</span></a>, provided online and TV\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwmJWvXxaCs\"><span class=\"s2\">coverage</span></a> as his casket was transferred from Addis Ababa to Hachalu\u2019s hometown, Ambo.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The slow, televised journey turned into a deadly battle between government authorities and opposition politicians over where Hachalu would be buried, and OMN interrupted its coverage as the hearse was forced to return to Addis Ababa. At least ten people were <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-53298845\"><span class=\"s2\">killed </span></a>and several were injured in Addis Ababa.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The scuffle led to the <a href=\"http://addisstandard.com/news-federal-police-accused-jawar-mohammed-and-others-of-attempts-to-repeat-june-22-high-level-assassinations/\"><span class=\"s2\">arrest</span></a> of several opposition politicians including Jawar Mohammed, an OMN figurehead, and opposition politician Bekele Gerba, who were both charged with instigating the mayhem.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Confusion swirled after government authorities eventually took Halachu's body back to Ambo by helicopter, where feuding parties continued to clash, denying the bereaved family members a proper burial.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Meanwhile, turmoil and violence ensued. A three-day rampage gripped parts of Oromia and Addis Ababa, <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/07/death-toll-ethiopia-violence-singer-killing-hits-239-200708075014258.html\"><span class=\"s2\">at a substantial cost</span></a>: 239 people were left dead; hundreds of others were injured and more than 7,000 people were arrested for violence and <a href=\"https://www.thereporterethiopia.com/article/inflection-point\"><span class=\"s2\">property damage</span></a> worth millions of Ethiopian birr.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">On June 30, the government imposed an\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nation.co.ke/kenya/news/africa/ethiopia-restores-full-internet-access-after-3-weeks-of-shutdown-1905118\">internet</a>\u00a0shutdown to attempt to halt calls for violence circulating on social media that lasted three weeks.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A number of people were shot and killed by government security forces, but several news outlets including <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/EthioTube/videos/2717252228519457/\"><span class=\"s2\">Voice of America </span></a>and <a href=\"https://addisstandard.com/in-depth-analysis-spate-of-targeted-attacks-excessive-use-of-force-by-security-in-oromia-leave-death-trails-destruction/\"><span class=\"s2\">Addis Standard </span></a>reported that angry mobs from the Oromo ethnic group attacked multiethnic, interfaith towns and cities in southeastern Oromia, targeting non-Oromo, non-Muslim families in the region.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Most of the violence fell along ethnic Amahara-Oromo lines, but religion may have played a more central role due to an intricate, localized understanding of ethnicity: The southeast Oromo community\u2019s ethnic identity markers usually <a href=\"http://africa.ufl.edu/files/CASRR2011.Ostebo.pdf\"><span class=\"s2\">combine </span></a>the religion of Islam and the Afan-Oromo language.

The rest of the interview contains other loaded issues of <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17531055.2020.1796255\">divisions and contradictions</a> within the Oromo community.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Throughout the interview, Guyo grilled Hachalu about the country\u2019s ongoing political reforms, stoking anti-government sentiment with questions about Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, himself an Oromo, and whether or not the government had met the demands of the Oromo people after the prime minister came to power in 2018.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hachalu reiterated his non-involvement in the rabid partisanship of Oromo politics but he did criticize those who question Abiy\u2019s Oromo identity.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">He defended his position against top Oromo opposition leaders who sought an alliance with the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), a once-dominant party with historic ties to the now-defunct Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Front (the EPRDF). The TPLF turned into an opposition party after Abiy dismantled the EPRDF.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Hachalu also addressed the political violence in the Oromia region, blaming both government authorities and the militant, splinter right-wing Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) militia group (informally known as OLF-Shane).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Following Hachalu\u2019s murder, the government was able to acquire and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQtk3leaC_Q&amp;t=200s\"><span class=\"s2\">release</span></a> the full 71-minute interview to the public. The missing tape included Hachalu\u2019s accounts of death threats he received from parts of western Oromia, where the radical OLF-Shane militia is active. Hachalu said he believed he would not have been attacked on social media if he had praised OLF-Shane.</p>\n\n<p class=\"p1\">He addressed a direct conflict he had with Getachew Assefa, Ethiopia\u2019s security and intelligence chief during the TPLF period.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Guyo, who promoted this interview on Facebook as \u201cmust-see TV\u201d in the days before its broadcast, has since been arrested and the government is investigating the full 71-minutes of interview tape for further clues that may help determine the facts regarding Hachalu's murder.</p>\n<p><i>Read more about the consequences of Hachalu Hundessa's murder in\u00a0<a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2020/08/07/how-the-murder-of-musician-hachalu-hundessa-incited-violence-in-ethiopia-part-ii/\">Part II.\u00a0</a></i></p>\n</div>", "comments": [{"id": "6110", "news_id": 438, "fallacy": "appeal to worse problems", "comment": "If you live in one of the poorest nations in the world and spend your time killing and protesting over a singer, you have you priorities screwed up!

They are eco-friendly, slow, and less prone to accidents. But the mixture of rickshaws, auto-rickshaws (or three-wheelers), motorcycles, buses, and cars on the road makes for chaotic and unpredictable traffic. There are often no separate rickshaw lanes separating this slow traffic on most of Dhaka's roads.</p>\n\n<p>The authorities barred all cycle rickshaws and other unauthorized motorized rickshaws such as battery-operated rickshaws in three important roadways and <a href=\"https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/dhaka/2019/07/06/3-major-routes-to-ban-rickshaws-from-sunday\">decided</a> to replace them with extended bus service.</p>\n<div class=\"factbox alignright\">\n<h4>Read More: <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2016/06/09/colorful-human-powered-rickshaws-rule-the-road-in-bangladeshs-capital-dhaka/\">Colorful, Human-Powered Rickshaws Rule the Road in Bangladesh's capital Dhaka</a></h4>\n</div>\n<h4>Is a ban on rickshaws the solution?</h4>\n<p>Subsequent to the announcement, public controversy surfaced as several thousand <a href=\"https://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/rickshaw-ban-pullers-block-portion-dhaka-road-1768723\">rickshaw-pullers took to the streets to protest\u00a0</a>and others expressed concern through their social media platforms.

An edited version is published below as part of a content-sharing agreement with Global Voices.</em></p>\n<p>Sri Lanka is seeing an <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/sri-lanka/\">uptick</a> in COVID-19 infections with 1,307 total infections with 1,180 new cases confirmed within seven days, as of October 10. Amid this increase, an unhealthy narrative is starting to take hold\u2014one centred on blaming others, imposing fear and frustration. The common refrain that goes, \u201cWhy could <em><u>they</u></em> not have been careful enough?\u201d is harmful and often leads to stigmatizing vulnerable communities that are affected by the virus.</p>\n<p>Understanding why we (and others) are struggling with maintaining safety measures is important for us to improve our safety habits and to shift from a culture of blaming to a culture that supports and leads with kindness.</p>\n<p><strong>What is pandemic fatigue?</strong></p>\n<p>I am sure that you have, by now, experienced growing tiredness related to safety measures, the anxiety that comes with missing a simple step, and frustration towards those who do not follow safety guidelines. This feeling of tiredness has probably seeped into your daily life and is constantly present. This is called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/how-to-deal-with-coronavirus-burnout-and-pandemic-fatigue\">pandemic fatigue</a>,\u201d and it is common to all of us regardless of nationality, ethnicity, profession or religion. The only effective way to counter pandemic fatigue is to lead with practical measures of kindness, both towards others and ourselves. Practical measures of kindness should be employed at every level, including personal, organizational and at the national policy level.</p>\n<p><strong>How do we counter pandemic fatigue?</strong></p>\n<p><em>Be kind, not silent</em></p>\n<p>At a personal level, support others who are struggling, by explaining that pandemic fatigue is a phenomenon that affects us all, but also reinforce the importance of continuing to be safe, and direct others <a href=\"https://connect.uclahealth.org/2020/07/07/7-steps-to-reduce-pandemic-fatigue/\">towards helpful resources</a>. Another important personal step is to minimize shaming, condescending, and acting with aggression towards those who miss safety steps in personal encounters and on social media. This does not mean remaining silent. It means offering kind reminders to follow health guidelines. The popular narrative that people respond to shaming or aggression\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/5/14/21257508/social-distancing-public-shaming-scolding-coronavirus\">is false and is not a sustainable method</a>. If you are a leader of an organization, sending gentle reminders on pandemic fatigue and the importance of being kind while remaining vigilant will go a long way towards maintaining the morale and safety of those who work under you.</p>\n<p><em>Use awareness, not fear</em></p>\n<p>It is also crucial that the government understands that pandemic fatigue affects its population. Such an understanding is important if we are to stop treating those who are infected with aggression or in a manner that causes fear and stigma. One of the negative points of Sri Lanka\u2019s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic is the lack of effort by the government to counter stigma. Recent examples can be seen in the way that factory workers were treated after testing positive for COVID-19, and the continuing false narratives targeting Muslims. Sri Lanka should strongly consider relying less on using fear of punishment to enforce COVID-19 containment policies and providing more science-based explanations that integrate the public in the effort.</p>\n<p>New Zealand\u2019s success largely depended on making the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2025203\">public part of the effort as well as effective explanations</a>\u00a0by the government. Sri Lanka needs to put more effort into explaining and re-explaining the science behind policies. The topics could focus on asymptomatic, or the pre-symptomatic spread of COVID-19, long-term impacts of contracting COVID-19 beyond recovery, the impact on the health system, how stigma or spreading rumors can lead to more infection spread and the importance of community support during this difficult time. As an initial idea to communicate science to the public, Sri Lanka can look to the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/media-resources/science-in-5#:~:text=WHO's%20Chief%20Scientist%20Dr%20Soumya%20Swaminathan%20explains%20in%20Science%20in%205.\">World Health Organization\u2019s COVID-19 <em>Science in 5</em> series</a>, an ongoing video and audio series that explains in five-minute episodes each key concept related to COVID-19.</p>\n<p><em>Equality in communication and in enforcement</em></p>\n<p>Confusion about COVID-19 policies and experiencing the selective application of containment policies can contribute further to pandemic fatigue, and the government, therefore, also has a responsibility to be clear, to communicate in all three languages (Sinhala, Tamil and English), and to apply containment policies without favouritism. These and other factors, inaccessibility of government guidelines or confusion about guidelines, and not countering stigma are missteps other countries have made that we can learn from. For example, confusion around health guidelines, and selective enforcement of the guidelines have resulted in a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/09/coronavirus-american-failure/614191/\">crisis in the United States</a>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Combat poor journalism</em></p>\n<p>Poor journalistic practices are as dangerous as the pandemic itself and are a major contributor to pandemic fatigue. Poor journalism ethics, both at the corporate and individual levels, that violate privacy, spread misinformation and stigma, provide an incomplete picture of the current status, and which favour political interests are extremely dangerous and intentionally put lives at risk. It is crucial that individual journalists and companies take the responsibility to follow ethical guidelines on reporting such as respecting privacy, not sensationalizing the news, providing accurate information, and using relevant headlines, as opposed to generating clickbait. International Media Support offers <a href=\"https://www.mediasupport.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMS-Covid-19-Reporting-Guidelines-V1.pdf\">useful reporting guidelines</a> as a start to improve or re-align harmful journalistic practices.</p>\n<p>We are all tired and wish this to be over. Pandemic fatigue has taken hold of us at a personal level, and at the policy level governments across the globe struggle to maintain the safety and economy of their countries. While the new normal is not easy, understanding that pandemic fatigue affects us all, and countering it with kindness and methods grounded in science will be the most effective way to succeed.</p>\n<p><em>The author is a former <a href=\"http://centerforpolicyimpact.org/people/\">Policy Associate at the Center for Policy Impact</a>\u00a0at the Duke Global Health Institute and is currently a PhD candidate focusing on global health policy at\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.mcgill.ca/\">McGill University</a></em>.</p>\n</div>", "comments": [{"id": "7627", "news_id": 543, "fallacy": "appeal to tradition", "comment": "In the United States, where I live, the long-standing way of doing things centers on our highest social ideal: personal liberty.

The nearest public health facility is 40 kilometers away, so the easiest way to get there is by motorbike taxi, for a return fare of 6,000 Malawi kwacha (about $8.02 United States dollars) \u2014 a huge price for subsistence farmers like Afiya.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Malawi\u2019s minimum wage is 1,346 MK ($1.80 USD) per day, making the motorbike fare the equivalent of five days\u2019 income.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Residents of Kanyenga are all too familiar with the sick dying on the way to the hospital, or pregnant women giving birth during the journey and sometimes losing the baby in the process.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Afiya was one of those who went into labor and struggled to reach the hospital in time.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI searched the village for a motorbike to hire, but I couldn\u2019t find any,\u201d she told ARTICLE 19. \u201cAt around 3 a.m. I gave birth to a baby boy right at home with the help of women from the neighborhood.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThe following morning, I managed to hire a motorbike and when I got to the hospital, I was told that the baby had caught severe pneumonia, apparently due to exposure to cold on the way; and just like that, I lost my baby,\u201d Afiya explained to ARTICLE 19.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Access to health services is a struggle for the majority of Malawians and in particular, the 84 percent of the population who live in rural areas. At the center of Malawi\u2019s vast gaps in health care provision are women and children who require specialists\u2019 services such as ante-natal, maternity care and under-five care.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href=\"https://extranet.who.int/countryplanningcycles/sites/default/files/planning_cycle_repository/malawi/health_sector_strategic_plan_ii_030417_smt_dps.pdf\">The Health Sector Strategic Plan II (2017-2022)</a></span> states, \u201c56 percent of Malawian adult women still cite distance to health facilities as a key barrier to healthcare access.\u201d The health system suffers from weak human resource capacity and an average vacancy rate of 67 percent for key clinical, nursing and technical posts.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The situation falls far short of both Malawian and international targets. Malawi\u2019s constitution commits to \u201cprovide adequate health care, commensurate with the health needs of Malawian society and international standards of health care.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The UN and the World Health Organization are aiming for Universal Health Coverage by the year 2030.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Due to these problems, health services became a central campaign issue in recent elections. The new government of the Tonse Alliance was elected on a range of promises, including the delivery of essential health care in the country.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As Afiya and her neighbors wait for the new government to deliver on those promises, civil society organizations in the country are heeding the calls of the local community and calling for action.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThrough the National Advocacy Forum, we make our presentations to the government on issues that impinge on the rights of the people,\u201d explains Emma Kaliya, a gender activist and executive director for Malawi Human Rights Resource Centre (MHRRC). \u201cWe have presented our manifesto to the president with regard to access to essential health care for women and children.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Kaliya is calling upon the government to urgently introduce mobile clinics to access remote and hard to reach areas such as Kanyenga village.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIssues around maternal and child health care must be a priority to help reduce mortality and morbidity\u00a0rates, which are still very high,\u201d says health care advocate and lobbyist, Dorothy Ngoma who, until 2018, was president for Malawi\u2019s National Organization for Nurses and Midwives.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Ngoma wants to see the government construct more maternity waiting homes and maternity units, and recruit more nurses, doctors and other clinical staff.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cI would like to say to the new government that both civil society and the people of Malawi are watching, and will not accept anything less,\u201d she told ARTICLE 19.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The government says it will continue to work to resolve these issues, assessing the interventions and resources available to people, particularly those living in rural areas.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dr. Charles Mwansambo from Malawi\u2019s Ministry of Health told ARTICLE 19: \u201cWe have developed a plan which, among other things, prioritizes the construction of health facilities in remote and hard-to-reach areas in order to improve the access to essential health services for all Malawians. However, the resource envelope is limited and as such we can only construct at a slower pace than preferred. The Ministry is therefore also working on mobilizing more resources from local and international development partners so we can construct more facilities.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Alongside the strain on health services during the pandemic, another major challenge has arisen: a surge in the number of child pregnancies and child marriages. Mangochi district recorded nearly 7,400 teen pregnancies from January to June in the year \u2014 an increase of more than 1,000 compared to the same period in 2019.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Ngoma fears possible complications ahead, as many may opt to have an abortion, which is legal in Malawi only in cases where the woman\u2019s life is at risk.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cWe must be ready to provide post-abortion services to pregnant girls, and we will need to support the parents whose daughters have been affected,\u201d she said.</p>\n</div>", "comments": [{"id": "3871", "news_id": 141, "fallacy": "none", "comment": "How is it that there are still places in the world where people can't even get medical help easily?

But the information was provided as an image on a map without any<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Accessibility/Alternative_text_for_images\"> alternative text</a>. For me, there wasn\u2019t any information I could access, I was both literally and figuratively blind,\u201d says Karina Ram\u00edrez, who is blind and uses a cane to get around. According to <a href=\"https://www.abilitynet.org.uk/news-blogs/inaccessible-websites-keep-disabled-people-out-work-abilitynet-tells-government-taskforce\">AbilityNet</a>, over 90 percent of websites are not accessible for people who are visually impaired.</p>\n<p>Once outside, maintaining social distancing led to a slew of challenges. \u201cI had a lot of questions and fears about how it would work when I needed to go outside, what it would be like to walk down the street, knowing that we blind people depend on guiding ourselves with sense of touch. Those types of situations were difficult, because of the fear of not knowing if you were exposing yourself [to COVID] and weren\u2019t able to do anything about it,\u201d said Karina, who is originally from Costa Rica and now lives in Madrid, Spain.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In northern Spain, in Sama, Asturias, Lida Margarita Carriazo felt similarly when she left home to do her shopping. She is from Colombia, where she worked as a teacher and owned a kindergarten. Her vision loss eventually progressed to total blindness and her guide dog Raquel is now her companion to navigate the world.</span></p>\n<p>During the pandemic, Lida and another blind person went to the supermarket to see what the experience would be like, while a video journalist filmed them. Lida explained how the other customers treated them with indifference. \u201cDo you think someone said to us, \u2018I\u2019ll help you,\u2019 or \u2018You should move up?\u2019 No, no they didn\u2019t!\u201d she said.</p>\n<h3><b>Work</b></h3>\n<p>In Santa Cruz, Bolivia, Margareth Dur\u00e1n Vaca is a member of the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tallabajascz/\">Asociaci\u00f3n de Personas de Talla Baja</a> (The Association for People of Short Stature, in English) and the mother of three children. She reflects on what isolation during the pandemic was like for her: \u201cIt was very difficult for us to get money, to go to the market. I was pregnant, and I remember I had to walk a long way to pick up my disability pension because cars weren't allowed.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>To make a living, Margareth and her family started selling homemade desserts in her neighborhood, even though it meant risking possible exposure to COVID. \u201cWe started doing it out of necessity. Thanks to our desserts business, we have managed to get by during the pandemic,\u201d said Margareth, who ended up contracting COVID-19, but has since recovered.</p>\n<p>However, leaving the house for work hasn\u2019t been an option for everyone during the pandemic. In Mexico City, Zar\u00eda Abreu Flores, a writer, playwright, and poet, is still confined to her house, even though isolation restrictions have been lifted. She is coping with <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/featured-topic/post-covid-syndrome-the-long-haul\">long COVID-19</a> as an acquired disability on top of autism, epilepsy, and a compromised immune system.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI lost my job. Financially I am no longer an independent person. Long COVID has progressively disabled me. I need to use oxygen some days, and some days I don\u2019t. I am in mandatory confinement, a prison. However, I have a lot of tools that I can draw on to manage my situation. Prior to the pandemic, there was a time when I was in a two-year depression, I couldn't get out of bed or leave the house. Going through that experience is really helping me cope now,\u201d she said.</p>\n<h3><b>The Vaccination Site</b></h3>\n\n<p>Cristina Francisco lives in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. She is the founder of the nonprofit organization called <a href=\"http://boletincimudis.blogspot.com/\">The Circle of Women with Disabilities</a> (CIMUDIS, in Spanish). She is paralyzed from the waist down and uses a wheelchair.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the pandemic, the Dominican Republic\u2019s government offered assistance to cope with the pandemic's effects, which required beneficiaries to be able to transport themselves to the office and wait in line. Cristina asked herself, \u201d \u2018How can I get there? There isn\u2019t a way!\u2019 My friends with disabilities and I were uncertain and fearful [about the situation] because the Dominican Republic\u2019s government policies did not consider protocols that included us.\u201d</p>\n<p>Cristina, along with other human rights advocates, pushed the government for improved access to public care: \u201cAs one voice, we all started to protest, attracting attention from the press, and things started to get better. When the vaccination process started, government organizations were ready, saying, \u2018If you have a disability, we will give you preference\u2019,\u201d she said.</p>\n\n<p>In Washington, D.C., Pamela Molina is the executive director of the <a href=\"https://wfdeaf.org/news/the-new-executive-director/\">World Federation of the Deaf</a>. Originally from Chile, she has gradually lost her hearing. When she went for her second COVID-19 vaccine, there was not a sign language interpreter present to answer her questions, even though she requested interpretation services ahead of time. \u201cThe vaccination site staff told me that I didn\u2019t need an interpreter in order to get my vaccine, but I told them that I wasn\u2019t comfortable getting vaccinated until an interpreter was there. They ended up connecting me with an interpreter via a video call. Fluid communication is important to me. Deaf people are doubly stressed [by communication], and that anxiety is even greater for deaf women,\u201d Pamela shared with her conversation partner, accompanied by sign language interpreter <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMLNvJb7Y/\">Lourdes Cruz</a>.</p>\n\n<p>However, not all challenges related to going out into the world have to do with vaccines. Those who need to continue medical treatments have also faced obstacles, including Karina in Madrid, who is blind. She was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor in her arm right before the global health crisis, which required her to make regular visits to the hospital for radiation therapy at the beginning of the pandemic. \u201cI felt like I was walking into the lion's den. I had to go in and out of the hospital by myself. After 23 sessions, I knew the way and everyone who worked there would help me. It was a difficult time, made even harder because of my disability,\u201d Karina said.</p>\n<p>Managing mental health has also been part of the ripple effects of the pandemic. To cope with <a href=\"https://www.sanidad.gob.es/gabinetePrensa/notaPrensa/pdf/decla041120191044276.pdf\">pandemic fatigue</a>, Lida looks to exercise: \u201cIn the gym, my personal trainer would say to me, \u2018Look, I can\u2019t touch you or guide you [because of COVID].\u2019 So I brought my cane from home, and he would hold one end and I would hold the other end. Truth be told, I found the whole thing a bit humiliating, but I made a decision to not sacrifice going to the gym. I laugh now, but being at the gym felt like a scary thing to do. It still does,\u201d she said.</p>\n<h3><b>The future\n</b></h3>\n<p>Learning to adapt, as Karina, Lida, Margareth, Zar\u00eda, Cristina, and Pamela have, will be a needed skill to face the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMnhWcptYp8&amp;t=123s\">future pandemics</a> predicted by the World Health Organization. Will spaces continue to be disabling, or will they adapt to people?</p>\n<p>From her forced isolation, Zar\u00eda reflected: \u201cI believe that the pandemic has changed people\u2019s mindset about what accessibility means. Many of us need to go out without the fear and risk of being infected. One of the most infuriating things I\u2019ve heard people say is that there\u2019s nothing to worry about because only the elderly and people with chronic conditions die [from COVID]. Only us! Changing that mindset isn\u2019t just up to government organizations, but to all of us.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"notes\">\n<p><em>\u201cPersisting in the Pandemic: Conversations between Latinas with disabilities\u201d was produced with support from the<a href=\"https://www.icfj.org/\"> International Center for Journalists</a> and the<a href=\"https://www.hearstfdn.org/about\"> Hearst Foundations</a> as part of the ICFJ-Hearst Foundations Global Health Crisis Reporting Grant.

On March 9<sup>th</sup>, 2018, the account of Feminist Voices in Weibo and Weixin was taken down. Feminist Voices was the most influential platform for women\u2019s rights advocacy in China, yet its account was shutdown after Women\u2019s Day. Some women\u2019s rights activists are still seeking to have the Feminist Voices\u2019 account brought back.\nMany netizens have taken part in advocacy activities against domestic violence today. Some went out and pasted a joint-statement against domestic violence in their community.\nPeople have been searching for light and for connections in the dark times of the lockdown. The desire to bring changes never disappears. Our hope can carry a tremendous amount of energy, and can explode at any time.\nYesterday, I tried to post my diary on Weibo and WeChat several times. The post either failed to be uploaded, or was deleted soon upon published. I was frustrated. I thought, perhaps my diary is not that important, so I thought about giving up. However, some people sent me private messages asking me why they did not see my diary yesterday.

Whenever I sit in front of my desk, all I can think about is the novel coronavirus. News about the virus come from all directions \u2013 east, south, west, north, front, back, up, and down \u2013 and bloom like dandelions. Eventually, I have lost all sense of direction. Around midnight, I blamed myself [for my failure to focus on something] and fell asleep with dandelions in my brain. I dreamed about ghosts, blood and moaning\u2026\nEveryday, I feel as if my heart is on fire. It is not a hasty feeling. At my age, I don't feel the need to act fast \u2013 As we say in Wuhan, what's the point of being so hasty? Going to the battlefield? The fire in my heart comes from the sudden spread of this weed-like coronavirus, the feeling of how it burns me cannot be described with words. I can tell a few stories though,\nA friend of mine told me that one of her classmates in high school and his wife were admitted to a hospital after they became very ill. The media covered that part of the story. They wanted to be in the same room, so they could take care of each other. The doctor did not agree. In the end, death and life separated them. He wanted to know what message his wife had left in her cellphone for him, but the funeral home threw her cellphone away! His condition is stable now, but his lung is seriously damaged. Try to think about that: how can he bear the scene of his home when he returns after the disaster, and finds out that his once sweet home has turned into an empty house!\nAnother friend told me that there will be a lot of bills to pay for medical expense and cremation later on. A family member of a diseased patient told me that the hospital and cremation place had called saying that the family had to pay 6 to 70,000 yuan (between USD 8,472 and 9885) for the 4-day medical expense, as the patient's status regarding the virus had not yet been confirmed by the time he died. Three members of the family had passed away within a little more than 20 days. How miserable!</p></blockquote>\n</div>", "comments": [{"id": "5913", "news_id": 372, "fallacy": "none", "comment": "This is an amazing first hand account of what happened.

We make jokes like \u201cI must be going crazy\u201d or \u201cI have a memory like a sieve\u201d, which could be defence mechanisms against real underlying worries, a way to escape from some cognitive deterioration we are suffering, or maybe just simple ignorance. Any of these situations is valid, as we all act, process, interpret and feel things in our own way. So, let's talk about the effects COVID-19 has on our mental health and how this illness could potentially be causing a deterioration in the cognitive functions of patients who have survived it. This damage could be irreversible if we don't tackle it in the right way.</p>\n<p>Let's imagine ourselves in Nicaragua, where I'm from, and where there is no plan of action in place to support mental health nor even <a href=\"https://scielosp.org/article/rpsp/2007.v22n5/348-357/\">specific legislation</a>\u00a0to look after it. As a medical student, I was able to witness and experience my country's health system from the inside, and I could see that it has many weaknesses. Mental health has not been a priority in the country because of successive political crises and natural disasters. The State is negligent and doesn't invest enough in something so highly important as health. As a result, the outlook for Nicaraguan society in terms of a complete recovery for people who have survived COVID-19 is very complicated.</p>\n<p>After speaking to someone who suffered trauma from not being able to breathe, and reading an article in <em>The Atlantic </em>about <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/05/coronavirus-icu-delirium/610546/\">delirium syndrome</a> and its relation to the coronavirus, I reached the conclusion that we need to talk about mental health and how mental disorders could get worse in people who have survived COVID-19.</p>\n<h3><strong>Delirium, or confusional states</strong></h3>\n<p>We can't talk about COVID-19 without mentioning acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which consists of severe damage to the lungs and a steep drop in arterial oxygen partial pressure (hypoxemia). This syndrome generally requires aggressive treatment such as a mechanical ventilator, and therefore treatment in intensive care to stabilise patients. According to <a href=\"https://books.google.es/books?hl=es&amp;lr=&amp;id=m6Wdcfn80DwC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP11&amp;dq=dsm+manual+diagn\u00f3stico+y+estad\u00edstico+de+los+trastornos+mentales&amp;ots=P8QfQ_x2zp&amp;sig=wnezWklvQvy8DJYH1CVwM1MtM9c#v=onepage&amp;q=dsm%20manual%20diagn%C3%B3stico%20y%20estad%C3%ADstico%20de%20los%20trastornos%20mentales&amp;f=false\">researchers</a>, hypoxaemia, which characterises ARDS, may cause delirium, otherwise known as a \u201cconfusional state\u201d, in patients in intensive care.</p>\n<p>In this state, patients may experience altered awareness and changes to their cognitive function which develop over a long period of time, according to the <a href=\"https://books.google.es/books?hl=es&amp;lr=&amp;id=m6Wdcfn80DwC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP11&amp;dq=dsm+manual+diagn\u00f3stico+y+estad\u00edstico+de+los+trastornos+mentales&amp;ots=P8QfQ_x2zp&amp;sig=wnezWklvQvy8DJYH1CVwM1MtM9c#v=onepage&amp;q=dsm%20manual%20diagn%C3%B3stico%20y%20estad%C3%ADstico%20de%20los%20trastornos%20mentales&amp;f=false\">psychiatric manual</a> written by researchers Juan Lopez-Ibor Ali\u00f1o y Manuel Vald\u00e9s Miyar.</p>\n<p><em>The Atlantic</em> <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/video/archive/2020/05/icu-delirium/611155/\">article</a> features accounts from COVID-19 survivors, who tell of the horror of feeling like their arms and legs are amputated or being at their own funerals. For many years, scientists have studied the direct relationship between ARDS and the creation of a state of delirium in people who are on intensive care wards, but other findings are even more shocking: over time, people who survive these episodes develop cognitive impairment that is undetected in functions such as memory, attention, concentration, processing speed or the executive functions of the brain, as demonstrated by <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10390379/\"><em>Hopkins et al</em></a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>Anxiety and depression</strong></h3>\n<p>Now let's focus on two conditions that so many people suffer from, and yet very few are aware of: anxiety and depression. According to <a href=\"https://www.pscp.tv/w/cfAkpzF6WUtiTHF5ZGtWRWV8MVlxR29Rb3ZMZGd4dvmMrH9l8KToT0FgOrwWcGHA1kgr4MdllfCtE6wx0IL_?t=1s&amp;s=09\">Nicaraguan psychologist Junieth Cruz</a>, it's very likely that most people have experienced an episode of anxiety at least once in their lives; however, we don't have enough health education recognise the symptoms.</p>\n<p>Studies <a href=\"https://www.sati.org.ar/files/seguimiento/07-Secuelaspsiquicas.pdf\">relating to surviving intensive care</a> have shown that following their medical discharge, many people develop psychological problems such as nightmares, panic attacks, agoraphobia, anxiety and depression. Moreover, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is often present, with people experiencing hyper-vigilance, reliving the traumatic experience, and avoidance.</p>\n<p>The symptoms of depression appear to improve over the course of the first year, after the patient is discharged, while anxiety lasts for longer than a year, but PTSD is a long-term condition, according to a study by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2875529/\"><em>Myhren et al</em></a>. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11313077/\"><em>H. Rothenh\u00e4usler et al</em></a> have shown that cognitive impairment and its effects can be observed six years after medical discharge, and that only 46% of people would be able to resume their former activities.</p>\n<p>If we are realistic about the public health crisis caused by COVID-19, how many survivors will be able to receive treatment for their mental health? Will the health authorities do anything to mitigate the mental health crisis following the pandemic? These are just two of the questions we could reflect on, not just in Nicaragua but in many other countries around the world.</p>\n<p>To summarise, we usually make the mistake of thinking of health as the absence of physical discomfort, without taking into account that to be healthy, we need to consider the balance between physical health and mental health. The demonisation of self-care and the taboo of discussing psychological struggles are things we have to tackle to avoid a spike in psychological and psychiatric patients, bearing in mind the psychological impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have in the medium and long term, and we must be able to swallow our pride and begin to accept help for our mental health.</p>\n<p>Now more than ever, we must have these discussions regarding everyone's physical and mental well-being and move away from outdated and obsolete statements such as \u201cI'm not going to a therapist because I'm not crazy.\u201d</p>\n</div>", "comments": [{"id": "6087", "news_id": 430, "fallacy": "none", "comment": "They may indeed have problems with their mental function but at this point they should be glad to be alive. they could also have physical effects that would be way worse.

The region has reported over\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.eac.int/coronavirus\">7,000 cases</a> as of June 14.</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Tanzania\">COVID-19 cases</a> began to rise in my home country of Tanzania, I became very concerned for my family members, all of whom have severe health issues that make them vulnerable to the virus.</p>\n<p>In the six years since I\u2019ve been studying in the United States, I\u2019ve only been able to travel home once a year to see my parents and grandfather, who still live in Mwanza, Tanzania. To help ensure that they and other Tanzanians stayed healthy and had access to information about the virus, I pulled together a team of people to<a href=\"https://covid19healthliteracyproject.com/#swahili\"> translate essential information</a> about the virus into Kiswahili, the most widely spoken language in Tanzania.</p>\n<p>The information was published as a series of fact sheets as part of the<a href=\"https://covid19healthliteracyproject.com/\"> COVID-19 Health Literacy project</a>, and our efforts were recognized by Tanzanian news outlets such as VijanaFM, which published the fact sheets on their<a href=\"https://www.vijana.fm/2020/03/31/maelezo-kuhusu-coronavirus-kutoka-covid-19-health-literacy-project-na-harvard-health-publishing/\"> website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But I still felt like I wasn\u2019t reaching enough people, especially those living in rural areas and those with limited access and literacy. So, on seeing the<a href=\"https://www.talenthouse.com/i/united-nations-global-call-out-to-creatives-help-stop-the-spread-of-covid-19\"> United Nations Global Talent Call to Creatives</a>, I decided to step out of my comfort zone and pull together a team to create a song to raise more awareness about COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Music is a big part of East African culture and has long been used in mediating conflict and strengthening community cohesion in<a href=\"https://global.oup.com/us/companion.websites/fdscontent/uscompanion/us/pdf/globalmusic/eastafrica/manual/ch1.pdf\"> rural areas</a>. Radio also remains a very popular medium in East African countries, and I believed that a song about COVID-19 could capture audiences in Tanzania on a large scale.</p>\n<p>In that way, after lots of rapid lyric-writing writing and late-night recording, \u201c<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-535823402/corona-tutaishinda\">Corona Tutaishinda</a>\u201d (\u201cWe will Defeat Corona\u201d) was created by Tanzanians scattered across the world.</p>\n<p>For this endeavor, I recruited some Tanzanian friends living in other countries who, like me, decided to pursue higher education abroad. First, I contacted a friend in Dubai who has a passion for making music and asked him to create a short music track for two verses and a chorus. Next, I reached out to two Tanzanians living in Boston and asked them to come up with some powerful lyrics. I recruited a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/artbyshamya/?hl=en\">Tanzanian artist</a> friend in Canada to create the album art.</p>\n\n<p>Recording the piece was by far the most challenging task. My only experience with singing was in theater in high school and in the Yale Russian Chorus in college. I had never rapped before nor even recorded myself singing. So I called in an expert\u2014a classmate who has his own podcast. After a brief lesson on using Garageband and a professional microphone, I went for it. Even an outdated computer that kept crashing mid-way through recording couldn\u2019t stop my zeal for making <a href=\"https://www.talenthouse.com/azan-virji\">this song</a> for my people.</p>\n<p>\u201c<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-535823402/corona-tutaishinda\">Corona Tutaishinda</a>\u201d not only educates listeners about COVID-19 but also provides a message of hope and solidarity.

All proceeds from online purchases go toward funding personal protective equipment (PPE) for Tanzanian frontline healthcare workers.</p>\n<h3><b>Providing PPE for Tanzanian frontline healthcare workers</b></h3>\n<p>The United States is home to <a href=\"https://archive.vn/20200212213139/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_3YR_S0201&amp;prodType=table\">tens of thousands</a> of Tanzanians who have emigrated from their home country and now call the US home. A group from the Tanzanian diaspora, myself included, have banded together to raise money to purchase PPE for frontline healthcare workers in Tanzania.</p>\n<p>Our initial goal was $25,000, which we were able to easily surpass earlier this month, raising over<a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/dhibiti-mlipuko-covid19-tanzania\"> $30,000</a>.</p>\n<p>The current plan is to purchase PPE in Tanzania, to support the local economy. To distribute the equipment, we plan to leverage regional medical officers of Dar es Salaam and Pwani regions, who have inside knowledge of which hospitals in their respective regions are in the most desperate need of PPE. Demonstrating and ensuring accountability is a top priority, so the group has recruited experts on the ground in Tanzania to confirm that the PPE is distributed to those who most need it.</p>\n<p>Our slogan, <i>umoja wetu, ndio nguvu yetu</i>\u2014\u201cour unity is our strength\u201d\u2014speaks to our emotional connection to Tanzania. Even though we are physically separated from our homeland, our commitment to helping Tanzania fight COVID-19 is strong.</p>\n<h3><b>Helping to alleviate food insecurity in Kenya</b></h3>\n<p>According to the World Bank, COVID-19 will push an estimated<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattperez/2020/05/19/world-bank-estimates-60-million-people-may-fall-into-extreme-poverty-due-to-coronavirus/#4edcc398572e\"> 60 million people</a> into extreme poverty. This, combined with regional mass flooding, will likely render millions of already poor people food insecure.</p>\n<p>Hanif Gilani, a native Kenyan who is currently an internal medicine resident at Griffin Hospital in Connecticut, was not prepared to wait for the severe food shortages to hit his country.</p>\n<p>Gilani partnered with fellow Kenyan Ashiana Jivraj, a student at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine, to start a nonprofit called,<a href=\"http://www.towakitukidogo.org/the-project\"> Towa Kitu Kidogo</a>, or Give Something Small. This is a colloquial expression used in Kenya when asking for bribes, but Gilani and Jivraj decided to reclaim it to demonstrate how small donations in the right hands can create a large impact if given to those who need it the most.\u00a0 To demonstrate accountability, they detail all donations and expenditure online on<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jKQnSqb_yxlDVyB_twlz5-3khKIhSXjT40NORNhLsCo/edit#gid=0\"> a public spreadsheet</a>.</p>\n<p>So far, the organization has raised over $15,000 and spent over $10,000 on initiatives such as feeding 150 first responders at the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching &amp; Referral Hospital in Kisumu, Kenya.</p>\n<p>Most recently, the NGO partnered with the Sikh Community in Kisumu to feed over 2,000 people confined to their homes because of the lockdown, and in some cases in communities that had been affected by flooding. Food deliveries were made in some cases by driving through two feet of water into villages that were cut off by the floods.</p>\n<p>Harnessing networks of friends, family, local organizations, and local partners have helped Towa Kitu Kidogo to identify diverse groups of people facing starvation and to address their needs.</p>\n<p>As the African proverb goes: \u201cIf you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together.\u201d</p>\n</div>", "comments": [{"id": "7682", "news_id": 562, "fallacy": "appeal to authority", "comment": "It is so wonderful that these people in the US with family and ties to Africa are doing so much good to spread the word in East Africa to help keep them safe from Covid 19.

It states that subscribers should receive notices on the information collected and for what purpose; subscribers must be presented with choices on the collection, use and disclosure of such information; and the subscriber must have access to such information and security measures in place to protect it.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the legal landscape in Nigeria on data protection is largely disconcerted considering how key government agencies seem to duplicate policies on data protection \u2014 both regulations discussed above seem to be directly related to access to subscribers\u2019 information in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This duplication of policies is largely due to the lack of a multistakeholder-sourced, comprehensive and primary data protection legislation in Nigeria.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The principles in the regulations mentioned above have also been </span><a href=\"https://www.gsma.com/publicpolicy/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/The-GSMA-COVID-19-Privacy-Guidelines.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">highlighted</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSMA) in their mobile privacy principles for COVID-19 in April 2020.</span></p>\n<h3>Establishing oversight for accountability</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the practical ways to implement these regulations is to establish an ad-hoc multi-stakeholder committee. Despite the provisions of Regulation 5 of the Telephone Subscribers\u2019 Regulation that the central database is the property of the Nigerian government, it is held in trust for Nigerian citizens and does not absolve the government of any likely claims on misuse in that regard should such arise.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A committee that oversees responsibility and compliance with the letter of the law within a practical time frame could help citizens protect their privacy while also combatting the novel coronavirus.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some points to consider:\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><strong>Representation:\u00a0</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The committee must draw its members from diverse stakeholders in the ICT sector, including government agencies, civil society, the private sector, research and development, policymakers, etcetera. This creates the possibility of mainstreaming accountability into state policy on access to citizens\u2019 information and combating COVID-19.</span></p>\n<p><b>Compliance and implementation</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: The bulk of this committee\u2019s responsibilities would be to comply with extant laws while also implementing others on access to subscribers\u2019 information. Subscriber consent is critical. However, most Nigerians are not immediately available to give such consent given the present circumstances. To mitigate negative effects, it is important to design more inclusive and accessible tools like USSD codes with opt-in and opt-out options that may be used to secure subscriber\u2019s consent. USSD, which means \u201cunstructured supplementary service data,\u201d is an interactive and menu-based technology supported on nearly all mobile phones. Its codes </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">allow users the possibility of accessing confirmation and consultation services through dialing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, to prepare for the possible fallout from the inability to secure consent from subscribers, the committee must ensure the publication of periodic audits on the use of subscribers\u2019 information in major newspapers online.</span></p>\n<p><b>Redress</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: This committee could create diverse mechanisms for seeking redress if and when subscribers feel aggrieved. There should be systems in place to address grievances with respect to data collection, uses and disclosures.</span></p>\n<p><b>Proactive disclosures</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: An important step toward accountability is transparency and to this end, the committee must inform the public on its scope, powers and functions. It must also disclose information about data usage, security measures and available means of redress. The committee can also determine the period of time for which such data will be used.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Combating COVID-19 through all available legal means is urgent. However, such means need not be at the expense of protecting human rights \u2014 including the right to privacy.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the central database for COVID-19 related measures requires the best designs to mitigate against the risk of privacy breaches.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The government\u2019s </span><a href=\"https://nairametrics.com/2020/04/17/fg-orders-nitda-to-design-framework-for-lawful-use-of-citizens-data/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recent call</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for data protection legislation seems late but it is still a welcome call in light of the current COVID-19 challenges.

It is worth noting that Egypt has been home for Islamists, represented mainly by the Muslim Brotherhood Organization which won the 2012 elections and was later toppled by Sisi in 2013. Since then, the Egyptian government has adopted a crackdown approach to Islamists.</p>\n<p>In fact, the proposed amendments go beyond military clauses and further strongly curtail judicial independence.

Earlier this year, she wrote an academic paper entitled \u201c<a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/80003691/LA_KOSMOVILIDAD_DE_LA_MADRE_TIERRA_CUANDO_HABLA_Y_EL_DISCURSO_JUR%C3%8DDICO_ACERCA_DE_LA_NATURALEZA_\">The <em>kosmovilidad</em> of mother earth when she \u2018speaks\u2019 and the legal discourse on \u2018nature\u2019</a>\u201d together with Willian Jairo Mavisoy Muchavisoy.

I am also motivated by an immense love and passion for the knowledge that I found not only in books, but in the beings I met and the experiences I had during my many years of career. And also by looking at the world with curiosity, respect, and responsibility. I think I try to follow, to some extent, my father's commitment to communities and to justice.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>MV: What is your current Ph.D. research focused on?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>FSJ:</strong> My Ph.D. thesis is about the potential connection between nature as a subject of law and the protection of Katsa Su, Big House, of the Aw\u00e1 people in Nari\u00f1o [a department in southeastern Colombia]. It is a deep dive into a question that surfaced when I was working on my legal article, which will be published, and which led me to delve into what it means to be a subject in the legal sphere, and what it means to be a being for the Aw\u00e1. It follows the work I did on the animals and their rights, since in both cases I study the possibility that other living beings are considered as <a href=\"https://revistas.juridicas.unam.mx/index.php/hechos-y-derechos/article/view/15245/16285\">rights holders</a>. I am passionate about the rights of mother earth, animals and native peoples, and the acknowledgement of other subjectivities.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>MV: Why is this topic important and relevant in the environmental and human rights context of Colombia?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>FSJ:</strong> It is important because it attempts to effectively protect nature by focusing on nature's rights, from various fronts, which environmental law has not achieved despite the many existing norms in a country like Colombia. With regard to human rights, this issue is relevant because the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Jurisdiction_for_Peace\">Special Jurisdiction for Peace</a>\u00a0recognized in 2019 that both Katsa Su and the Aw\u00e1 people were victims [of the armed conflict in Colombia that began in the 1960s], and it is necessary to analyze whether the decision has had a positive impact on the Aw\u00e1 people and their land since then.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>MV: What is \u201clegal colonialism\u201d?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>FSJ: </strong>Legal colonialism has its roots in Eurocentric thought and in the myths of modern law, as highlighted by law historian Paolo Grossi. The Colombian legal system is part of what is known as the continental law system. It has inherited its institutions and its sources from it, and even our civil code was \u201ccopied\u201d from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Code\">Napoleonic Code</a>. We have received the laws rather than produced them. The colonialism of legal discourse is marked by binary thinking, which excludes and separates. For example, there is a predominant dichotomy between who is the object and who is the subject, which are key concepts in my academic research. It is also reflected in how <a href=\"https://www.servindi.org/actualidad-opinion/10/09/2020/el-colonialismo-en-el-abordaje-de-los-conflictos-socio-ambientales\">socio-environmental issues</a> are handled.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>MV: What is the difference between how the Aw\u00e1 and Kam\u00ebnts\u00e1 peoples see their environment and how it is seen from the West?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>FSJ:</strong> The main difference lies in the fact that for these peoples everything that lives is \u201cpeople.\u201d That is to say, that the dichotomy imposed by modernity and colonialism does not exist for them. They view themselves as part of a whole, and the beings with whom they share their home are considered people, who can feel, who can bleed, who can help, but who can also punish if they are disobeyed or disrespected. They have lived in communion with these beings for centuries and they continue to live in <a href=\"https://www.servindi.org/actualidad-opinion/22/03/2022/vida-en-katsa-su-en-la-voz-de-una-lideresa-awa-claudia-pai\">harmony</a> with them. They see their surroundings as a mother, not as a natural resource to be exploited at their convenience, and they practice reciprocity.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>MV: What impact could these perspectives have on how the world is perceived?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>FSJ:</strong> The impact they have had is big. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Berry\">Thomas Berry</a>, a pioneer in land rights defense, was inspired by the thinking of Indigenous peoples; the Wild Law Manifesto. [Lawyer] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormac_Cullinan\">Cormac Cullinan</a> also echoes many ideas that exist among indigenous peoples not only from Abya Yala, but from all over the world. Nature's rights are <a href=\"https://www.servindi.org/actualidad-entrevistas/07/08/2022/los-derechos-de-la-naturaleza-fueron-construidos-con-base-en-el\">inspired by the thinking and traditions of Indigenous peoples</a>. As such, they have been influential in creating other ways of being in the world, but they clash against the power of transnational capitalism that seeks to maintain the status quo and keep <a href=\"https://www.biodiversidadla.org/Documentos/La-naturaleza-en-venta\">nature for sale</a>.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>MV: How would you like to see the future of Colombia's judicial system?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>FSJ:</strong> Not only in Colombia, but in the world. I believe that we need a legal system that takes into account the land that we share with multiple beings, such as rivers, forests, other animals, and that includes in the legal analysis the knowledge of the ancestral peoples that have been excluded throughout time because they were deemed non-scientific. Law is a social and cultural construct that cannot be kept unchanged. It must respond to the needs of its time; we cannot turn to only nineteenth-century law to understand the world or to organize it. I would like a system where justice is done, where laws and knowledge produced elsewhere are incorporated, as well as an <a href=\"https://revistas.upaep.mx/index.php/ayh/article/view/296\">intercultural legal narrative</a>.</p></blockquote>\n</div>", "comments": [{"id": "5566", "news_id": 256, "fallacy": "hasty generalization", "comment": "It is wrong to hold a person hostage because of their spirituality.

The study found that 21 governments, including Sudan, used the company's Remote Control System (RCS) which \u2018\u2019enables government surveillance of a target\u2019s encrypted internet communications, even when the target is connected to a network that the government cannot wiretap.\u2019\u2019 According to the same report:\u00a0</p>\n<blockquote><p>RCS\u2019s capabilities include the ability to copy files from a computer\u2019s hard disk, record Skype calls, emails, instant messages, and passwords typed into a web browser Furthermore, RCS can turn on a device\u2019s webcam and microphone to spy on the target</p></blockquote>\n<p>This collaboration between Hacking Team and the Sudanese government did not go unnoticed and the international community questioned it. In June 2014,\u00a0 the United Nations asked Hacking Team to provide information about its sales to the Sudanese government. According to a <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/07/07/leaked-documents-confirm-hacking-team-sells-spyware-repressive-countries/\">report</a> by the Intercept, \u201cthe internal records proved that Sudan\u2019s National Intelligence and Security Service paid\u00a0 960,000 euros [$1,071,504 United States dollars] for Remote Control System.\u201d </p>\n<h3>Existing legal framework</h3>\n\n<p>Under Sudanese law, authorities could access user data after obtaining an order form a prosecutor or judge. Article 74 of the <a href=\"http://moj.gov.sd/sudanlaws/#/reader/chapter/214\">2018\u00a0 Telecommunications and-Postal Regulation Act</a>\u00a0clearly permits interception, surveillance and eavesdropping \u2014 only on order from the prosecutor or a specialized judge \u2014 and violators are punished with five years in prison, fine or both.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Unauthorised interception and eavesdropping is illegal.\u00a0For example, the<a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/res/cld/document/sdn/2007/cybercrime_act_2007_html/Sudan_Cybercrime_Act_2007_EN.pdf\"> 2007 Cybercrime Act</a> prescribes a punishment of up to three years in jail, a fine or both against anyone \u201cwho taps, captures or intercepts any message through an information network or computer hardware or similar without permission from the public prosecutor or the competent authority or the party to which the information belongs.\u2019\u2019 The term \u2018\u2019competent authority\u2019\u2019 is not defined, making the law subject to abuse.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Article 28 of the 2007<a href=\"http://moj.gov.sd/sudanlaws/#/reader/chapter/265\"> Electronic Transactions Act</a>\u00a0punishes anyone who discloses encrypted data for any unauthorized party or access any piece of information without approval,\u00a0with ten years in prison or fine or both. The Act deals with financial transactions such as online payments and legal contracts.\u00a0</p>\n<p>While the <a href=\"http://www.undp-aciac.org/publications/Anti-corruption%20Act%20Sudan.pdf\">2016 Anti-corruption Act </a>cherished the privacy rights of whistleblowers, punishing anyone who reveals their personal data\u00a0with two years in prison, or fine or both.</p>\n<h3>Legal void</h3>\n<p>While these laws offer some protection, in practice they are not enough to protect Sudanese users\u2019 privacy and data from government surveillance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In fact, the use of surveillance tools such as Hacking Team\u2019s RCS system and Blue Coat ProxySG by the former regime, is evidence of how it was possible for the authorities to violate users\u2019 privacy, without needing to obtain a court order.</p>\n<p>The use of vague terms such as\u00a0 \u201ccompetent authority\u201d\u2014 as in the 2017 Cybercrime Act \u2014 without any clear definition, gives telecommunications companies a pretext to hand over user information to security agencies \u2014 even in the absence of a court order.</p>\n<p>Independent supervision over how the government and the private sector handle personal data is lacking in Sudan. For example, in February 2014, the Sudanese parliament publicly discussed the invasion of privacy by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Intelligence_and_Security_Service\">National Intelligence and Security Service</a> ( NISS<b>) </b>through ISPs and telecommunication companies, such as <a href=\"https://www.mtn.sd/home/\">MTN-Sudan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sd.zain.com/English/pages/home.aspx\">ZAIN</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sudatel.sd/about-us/our-markets/\">SUDANI</a> and <a href=\"https://canar.sd/\">CANAR</a>. </p>\n<p>No independent investigation was launched and local media reported that the then-telecommunications minister\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.altareeq.info/ar/control-the-internet-and-phones-open-spaces-in-the-hands-of-the-security/\">refused</a> to answer whether or not monitoring of phone calls and online activities was legally taking place.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In fact, Sudan has no data protection authority and no <a href=\"https://privacyinternational.org/learning-topics/data-protection\">data protection law</a> that regulates the collection, storage and use of personal data by governments and the private sector. A basic principle of an effective data protection law is the establishment of an independent regulator that oversees the law\u2019s implementation. In the absence of such a legal framework, personal data will remain at risk of misuse and abuse not only by the government but also the private sector.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The current, existing legal framework does not include any provisions that require companies, websites and organizations to share or have a written policy that explains their data collection and sharing practices.\u00a0</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Sudanese websites, applications, online platforms MUST have (Terms and conditions of Use ) and (Privacy policy ) hich explains how information about customers is collected, used disclosud and analysed. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/privacylaws?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#privacylaws</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Sudan?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Sudan</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Amr Mohsen (@AmrMohsenadvo) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmrMohsenadvo/status/1189885523827023872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 31, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>For example, emerging online businesses in Sudan that depend primarily on e-payment, lack transparency about how they handle their users\u2019 information.

In addition, the court <a href=\"https://maldivestimes.com/top-court-annuls-verdict-to-oust-floor-crossing-mps-from-parliament/\">nullified an anti-defection ruling</a> in which 12 legislators lost their parliamentary seats for defecting last July from the ruling party. The court has also ordered new trials for the accused opposition leaders, but the government appears to be stalling for time. </p>\n<p>The situation is being called a judicial coup, as it may lead to the impeachment of the incumbent president, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdulla_Yameen\">Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom</a>. Last year, a process of impeachment was stalled by the <a href=\"http://maldivesindependent.com/politics/mps-will-forfeit-seat-for-leaving-party-supreme-court-rules-131486\">anti-defection ruling</a> by the Supreme court restricting members of parliament from crossing the floor \u2014 so the number of Members of Parliament (MPs) required for impeachment was not available. These recent events are the latest in the political <a href=\"http://maldivesindependent.com/politics/the-state-were-in-politics-in-the-maldives-135542\">roller coaster </a>the Maldives has witnessed in the last few years.</p>\n<p>Global Voices talked to an activist in Mal\u00e9 who discussed this alleged judicial coup in a private update. (The activist's name and the link to the restricted social media statement have been withheld for safety reasons):</p>\n<blockquote><p>It is four hours past midnight in the Maldives, and here in Mal\u00e9, the capital city, the sound of police sirens are heard in the distance as another coup is unfolding. It is a judicial coup this time; the country\u2019s Supreme Court has ruled tonight to release all high-level political prisoners and that no parliamentarian would lose the seat for switching her or his political party. Ironically it is the same Supreme Court which had <a href=\"http://maldivesindependent.com/politics/supreme-court-asked-to-disqualify-lawmakers-who-switch-parties-131444\">ruled a couple of months</a> ago that parliamentarians would lose seats for floor crossing and kept the status of some 12 MPs in limbo when they tried to defect from the ruling party to the opposition. That ruling was a lifeline for the increasingly sidelined autocratic president Yameen Abdul Gayoom. It is also the same Supreme Court which had meddled in the presidential election of 2013, paving the way for Yameen to come to power in the first place. While some of the opposition supporters have hailed the Supreme Court judges as heroes tonight, it must be remembered that <a href=\"http://maldivesindependent.com/politics/maldives-supreme-court-a-law-unto-itself-135567\">their actions are significant</a> in the slide of Maldives back to a dictatorship. They have been known to take over new powers and authority which were never granted to them by the constitution and to encroach on the powers of the parliament to the extent that the Supreme Court had morphed into a lawmaking body.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile, the prisoners still have not been released, and the Maldivian government is <a href=\"https://avas.mv/en/44001\">claiming that</a> the top court document needs to be validated before it can implement the court's orders.

At times political foes and at times friends, they have orchestrated coups, looted the treasury and made local politics dirtier. As for Yameen, the lesson he had learned from Machiavelli\u2019s The Prince seems to be to become a leader who is feared rather than a leader who is loved. In his four years in power, he has reduced independent institutions to mere puppets, imprisoned all political opponents, introduced laws to <a href=\"https://www.ifex.org/maldives/2016/07/02/dismantling_critical_media/\">block independent media</a> and unbiased reporting, and consolidated his power with the assistance of the judiciary. He kept <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maldives-close-to-free-trade-agreement-with-china-india-caught-unawares/story-u0qLPWNMv7SZT6QMxmCqvN.html\">China close</a>, upsetting India and the United States. Recently his government signed a free trade agreement with China, which has been criticised by the former president Mohamed Nasheed\u2019s party as inviting China to grab lands in the Maldives. Ironically it was with the assistance of Nasheed\u2019s party MDP that the government was able to pass the laws which facilitate such land grabs.</p>\n<p>Yameen also ventured into a taboo territory recently when he <a href=\"http://maldivesindependent.com/politics/opposition-leaders-resorts-raided-by-police-and-customs-135250\">cracked down</a> on some tourist resorts, sending police and customs officials to search the resorts and confiscate the liquor there. While he ordered this as a crackdown against a tycoon who happens to be one of his political opponents, this move must have unnerved the influential businessmen in the tourism industry [\u2026] it is those tycoons who wield the real power in the Maldives and any threat to their resorts or their businesses is bound to have repercussions.</p>\n<p>[\u2026] Yameen is playing his last card by <a href=\"https://www.expressnews.com/news/crime/article/Clashes-in-Maldives-after-court-orders-12545031.php\">unleashing the police</a> on opposition protesters, spraying them with tear gas and brutally beating them.

On February 20, 2022, when opposition leader Nelson Chamisa of the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) drew thousands of supporters to his maiden election rally in the capital city, Harare, internet watchdog </span><a href=\"https://netblocks.org/reports/internet-slowdown-limits-coverage-of-zimbabwe-opposition-rally-oy9Ykoy3\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NetBlocks reported</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a significant throttling of internet services, which disrupted live streaming of the rally.

Instead, the country has backslid into populist and military backed strongman rule. After Mugabe was toppled in a military coup in November 2017, his successor Emmerson Mnangagwa pushed for normalization of ties with the international community but this has not happened. Instead, on February 21, 2022, the European Union (EU) extended a decades-old embargo against Mnangagwa\u2019s administration, citing continued rights abuses.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIntimidation of political opposition and other government critics has continued to restrict the democratic and civic space, which is under threat of shrinking further through the Data Protection Act and ongoing legislative processes such as the Private Voluntary Organizations Amendment Bill and the envisaged so-called Patriotic Act.

This law amends provisions of three pieces of legislation: the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform Act) (Chapter 9:23), the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Act (Chapter 9:07) and the Interception of Communications Act (Chapter 11:20).\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clause 164c of the act criminalizes the spread of what the government classifies as \u201cfalse\u201d information online, punishable with a jail term of up to five years, or a fine, or both.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier in February, in an emailed and telephone interview with human rights lawyer Misheck Marava pointed out that this law does not qualify nor define that which it refers to as false, leaving room for wide interpretation and\u00a0 making it prone to abuse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe provision, in other words, is criminal defamation renamed. Zimbabwe had outlawed criminal defamation but, to the surprise of the nation, this has been revived by this particular provision,\u201d Marava said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He pointed out that the act ceases to be a data protection law and becomes, rather, a tool to protect the state, a cyber-crime tool.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marava holds that the original intention in drafting the law as a data protection tool has been overridden by state protection interests, adding that the act is likely to be a tool against expressing anti-government sentiments, which can easily be interpreted as incitement of violence or injurious falsehoods.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Section 12 of the act makes it necessary to obtain consent in writing to process a citizen\u2019s genetic, biometric and health data. However, it does not apply \u201cwhere the processing is necessary to comply with national security laws or\u2026for reasons of substantial public interest.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In another interview during the same month, human rights lawyer Kelvin Kabaya told </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Global Voices over email</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, that this provision falls short of constitutional obligations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe proviso to the section is couched in a very wide manner and is capable of being abused. Phrases such as substantial interest, are incapable of a precise meaning. This proviso may fail the constitutional muster, in that it is vague and may violate the right to privacy.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The law also provides for a Data Protection Authority to establish rules authorizing\u00a0 and governing the whistleblowing system. Kabaya contends that this provision can be used to clamp down on legitimate journalistic work and whistleblowers exposing corruption. In 2020, for example, investigative journalist Hopewell Chin\u2019ono </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jul/09/zimbabwe-health-minister-facing-coronavirus-corruption-charge-sacked\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exposed corruption</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the use of COVID-19 funds, which led to the sacking of former Health minister Obadiah Moyo.

This is clearly not the intention of the FATF Recommendations,\u201d said Kabaya.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Successful promulgation of this law could be a long awaited trump card for the ruling party ZANU PF, which has for years accused CSOs of fronting a Western agenda </span><a href=\"https://www.herald.co.zw/minister-slams-west-for-advancing-regime-change-agenda/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of regime change</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in Zimbabwe.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kabaya explained that the amendments are likely to affect Zimbabwean citizens who are beneficiaries of the work of CSOs involved in digital rights and there is likely to be widening of the information gap on digital rights as some digital rights CSOs may actually close.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This raft of repression enabling legislative acts continues to stifle the digital rights of internet users and enable digital authoritarianism in Zimbabwe.</span></p>\n\n\n<h3>Please visit the project page for more pieces from the <a href=\"https://advox.globalvoices.org/special/unfreedom-monitor/\">Unfreedom Monitor</a>.</h3>\n</div>", "comments": [{"id": "5602", "news_id": 268, "fallacy": "appeal to worse problems", "comment": "While I understand the need for digital rights, is it that important?

In a Facebook post, the Army officer asked Lalu if he was a propagandist for the New People\u2019s Army (NPA), the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines.</p>\n<p>In April 2020, the Philippine National Police <a href=\"https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2020/04/07/2005988/cyber-cops-arrest-32-fake-news\">arrested 32 individuals</a> for spreading \u201cfake news\u201d via social media platforms. They were charged with unlawful use of means of publication and unlawful utterance under Article 154 of the Revised Penal Code and violation of Republic Act (RA) 10175 or the Anti-Cybercrime Prevention Act.

Peace consultants, including those detained over trumped-up charges, were also designated as terrorists by the ATC.</p>\n<p>In January 2023, community doctor <a href=\"https://www.bulatlat.com/2023/01/31/terrorist-designation-of-red-tagged-doc-baseless-and-malicious-rights-group/\">Naty Castro</a> who served the Indigenous peoples in Northern Mindanao was branded a terrorist. Castro was arrested and detained over charges of kidnapping and serious illegal detention but was eventually <a href=\"https://www.bulatlat.com/2022/03/31/rights-group-hails-community-doctor-naty-castros-release/\">released</a> after a court junked the cases against her in March 2022.</p>\n<p>The ATC\u2019s resolutions have also been used as justification for <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2023/05/22/unfreedom-monitor-report-philippines/\">censorship</a>. In June 2022, the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) issued a memorandum ordering internet service providers to block 27 websites over alleged terrorist links. The NTC issued the memorandum after then National Security Adviser Hermogenes Esperon Jr, citing three ATC resolutions, wrote to the NTC \u201crequesting\u201d the latter to block a list of websites.</p>\n<p>The majority of the websites in Esperon\u2019s list are not even designated as terrorists, such as media outfits Bulatlat and Pinoy Weekly, progressive groups Bayan, Pamalakaya, Amihan and Rural Missionaries of the Philippines, among others.</p>\n<p>The blocking of the websites was done without prior notice or due process. Neither the ATA nor the Cybercrime Prevention Act contains provisions allowing government agencies to block websites. Bulatlat filed a civil case seeking the nullification of the NTC memorandum.</p>\n<h3><strong>Chilling effect</strong></h3>\n<p>The restrictions and repressive measures imposed during the pandemic have had\u00a0a chilling effect on the populace. In an attempt to isolate and discredit critics and dissenters, government officials and their trolls on social media resorted to <a href=\"https://advox.globalvoices.org/2023/04/27/what-is-red-tagging-and-why-it-is-dangerous-in-the-philippines/\">red-tagging</a> and terrorist labelling, especially during the lockdown. Such red-tagging intensified during the deliberations for the Anti-Terror Bill, with those who were vocal in their opposition being labelled as communists and terrorists. Church leaders, journalists, humanitarian aid workers, and even artists were not spared from such labelling.</p>\n<p>In the Philippines, red-tagging often leads to harm. Human rights group Karapatan <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1573277/badoy-says-red-tagging-not-dangerous-but-427-slain-activists-show-otherwise\">said</a> at least 427 activists were red-tagged before they were gunned down. Others who were red-tagged were also subjected to surveillance and experienced threats from suspected state forces.</p>\n<h3><strong>New administration, same policies</strong></h3>\n<p>Under the new Marcos administration, there seem to be no substantial changes in policies related to human rights. The ATA is still in effect; red-tagging continues, and so with the repression of free speech and expression.</p>\n<p>In the president\u2019s first 100 days in office, a new threat in the digital space loomed with the passage of the <a href=\"https://www.rappler.com/business/marcos-jr-signs-sim-card-registration-act-will-really-stop-scammers/\">SIM Card Registration Act</a>, the first law signed by Marcos Jr. Human and digital rights groups <a href=\"https://engagemedia.org/2022/philippines-sim-registration/\">have raised the alarm</a> over the measure because of its impact on privacy, data security, and free expression. Coupled with the ATA, human rights groups fear that state surveillance is complete.</p>\n<p>These examples illustrate how pandemic-era measures, enacted at a time when the Philippines was occupied with containing a deadly virus, are now coming to bear on Filipinos\u2019 civil and political rights. As the full impact of these policies \u2014 and the potential for abuse and misuse \u2014 are becoming more evident,\u00a0human and digital rights advocates in the Philippines will need to step up efforts to push back at these attempts to normalise rights-infringing policies.</p>\n<p><em>*Ronalyn Olea is the editor-in-chief of the Philippine alternative online news publication <a href=\"https://www.bulatlat.com/\">Bulatlat</a>.

However, some provisions of the act are being weaponized by the Nigerian government to clamp down on online expression in Nigeria.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, section 146(2) of the act provides that, upon a written request by the NCC, an ISP must assist in the prevention of an offense in Nigeria. Section 148(1) of the act then provides for instances where the NCC may act in the interest of public safety to suspend the license of an ISP, withdraw the services or network facilities of an ISP, order that a specified communication should not be communicated from or to an ISP, or order taking over an ISP\u2019s equipment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to these provisions, section 53(2) of the act requires that, before the NCC issues a direction in writing to ISPs for compliance or non-compliance with the act, a person against whom such direction is issued must be provided with a notice to defend their actions. In the examples highlighted above, there was no evidence that the NCC complied with section 53(2).</span></p>\n<h3><b>Legal obligations to protect online expression\u00a0</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Section 39 of the </span><a href=\"https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Nigeria_1999.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1999 Constitution of Nigeria</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> guarantees the protection of the right to freedom of expression, opinion and access to information. The right is not absolute and can be limited in some instances. However, such instances must be clear, and they are provided for under section 45 of the Constitution. It states that limitations of the right must be </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reasonably justifiable in a democratic society </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to protect public interest and the rights of others.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to these provisions, the Nigerian government also has obligations to protect the right under international human rights standards such as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights\">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a> (ICCPR) and the<a href=\"https://www.achpr.org/legalinstruments/detail?id=49\"> African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights</a> (African Charter). Article 19(1) and (2) of the ICCPR say that everyone has the right to their opinion and expression. </span><a href=\"https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G11/132/01/PDF/G1113201.pdf?OpenElement\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Article 19(3)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0has also been interpreted to mean that, for the right to freedom of expression to be limited, it must be provided for by law, it must be based on a legitimate reason, the measure used to restrict such right must be proportional, and the restriction must be necessary.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Article 9 of the African Charter also guarantees the right to freedom of expression. In addition, in 2019, the African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, fulfilling its mandate to protect the rights provided for under the African Charter, recently revised the </span><a href=\"https://www.achpr.org/public/Document/file/English/Declaration%20of%20Principles%20on%20Freedom%20of%20Expression_ENG_2019.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Principle 38 of the revised declaration holds that states shall not interfere with individuals\u2019 right to receive and impart information online by blocking content, except when such interference is in line with international human rights standards.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the provisions of section 146 of the NCA highlighted above provides for legitimate instances such as public safety or public emergencies to block online content, the outright blocking of websites without considering other least intrusive measures like limiting specific content does not comply with Nigeria\u2019s Constitution and internationally set standards. In addition to this, the Nigerian government has not shown any verifiable connection between this content and the harm it supposedly causes. It appears that the Nigerian government weaponises the term \u201cnational security\u201d to clamp down on online expression without providing any specific examples to justify its use or show that its actions are </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reasonably justifiable in a democratic society.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a way forward, policymakers, the private sector and civil society need to note that laws like the NCA are being weaponised against online expression in Nigeria. The National Assembly should ensure a digital rights approach to its laws, and</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> laws like the NCA must be brought in line with constitutional and international human rights standards. This includes amending the provisions of the NCA and ensuring that, at least, laws that ought to protect digital rights like online expression are not used to violate it.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Civil society also has a crucial role to play in monitoring the reforms and implementation of laws that impact online expression in Nigeria. This can be done by strategic advocacy that knows when to name abuse of state powers, when to shame it, and when to collaborate for meaningful policy reforms. This advocacy can also train strategic stakeholders like legislators, government agencies, law enforcement and other state actors on the importance of free online expression.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, ISPs will need to stop rolling over and maximize their economic power to demand the protection of online expression in Nigeria. It is not in the best interest of anyone that human rights protection is allowed to be sacrificed on the altar of business.</span></p>\n</div>", "comments": [{"id": "7380", "news_id": 461, "fallacy": "slippery slope", "comment": "If they can already censor the internet for reasons that aren't clear or consistent, then next they could imprison people for the same reasons.

She laments, however, that it can get tiring having the VPNs affecting her other apps such as Pinterest where she is forced to view posts in another language.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nwalema, a young content creator, social media influencer, and model is also feeling the Twitter ban.

She fears that \u201cInstagram might be next\u201d to be banned by the government, even though the government has not said they would ban the platform She worries that the licensing or even possible ban of all social media platforms in the country will spell doom for her and other influencers, especially students who earn a living from the platform.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Others use Twitter as a platform to express their socio-political opinions and make a difference through advocacy. One of such online activists is Chisom Agbodike, a 19-year-old student studying in Ekiti in southwestern Nigeria. Agbodike advocates for LGBTQ+ rights and uses the platform to express these views. Since the Twitter ban began, many young Nigerians, including Agbodike, have been on edge because of the scary thought of the country slowly becoming autocratic as opposed to democratic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Lagos jewelry owner, Nwalema, and Agbodike are just a few examples of the millions of Nigerian youths who have found solace in social media \u2014 be it purely for entertainment, to have their voices heard, or to earn a living \u2014 and are now being restricted by the government.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing that can be sure is that many young people have lost hope in the democracy that Nigeria claims to be practicing.

Paul was given two boxes with food, each decorated with the national flag of the team playing that day. Paul's prediction was based on which of these boxes he ate from first. One may ask, what on earth Paul has to do with a recent election in Azerbaijan?</p>\n<p>Judging by the peculiar results, elections in this country on the shores of the Caspian Sea might as well be controlled by an octopus. On February 9, Azerbaijan held an early parliamentary election, nine months ahead of schedule. Although the decision was first proposed by the country's National Assembly, where 99.8 percent of deputies voted to dissolve parliament, the move was pushed forward by longtime President Ilham Aliyev who accepted the proposal in November and dismissed the legislature in December. Aliyev's decision to hold a snap election caught many observers by surprise. After municipal elections on December 23, the country's opposition had little time to turn around and start preparing for February 9.</p>\n<p>Paul was given a fair choice. Although Azerbaijan's voters faced a choice of over 1,300 candidates, many pundits inside the country believed that the results of the election had been determined in advance.\u00a0Nevertheless, Azerbaijan's authorities made an effort to convince the world of the transparency of their electoral system and integrity of the country's democracy\u00a0\u2014 international human rights watchdogs <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/azerbaijan\">remain to be convinced</a>.</p>\n<p>That's why some opposition parties boycotted the election. Others decided to participate, regardless of the predictions and aware that their chances of victory were very low. Nevertheless, candidates seen as loyal to the ruling <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Azerbaijan_Party\">New Azerbaijan Party</a> won all but one of the 125 seats in the National Assembly. And although some observers <a href=\"https://eurasianet.org/in-azerbaijan-surprise-elections-yield-usual-results\">had been wondering</a> whether the authorities were planning to bring new faces into Azerbaijani politics, 87 parliamentarians kept their seats.</p>\n<p>Turnout was low at just 48 percent.</p>\n<h3>A traditional election day</h3>\n<p>\u201cThe restrictive legislation and political environment prevented genuine competition,\u201d reads the <a href=\"https://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/azerbaijan/445759?\">preliminary report</a> by election observers from the OSCE (Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe), released on February 10.

As a result, reactions both internationally and locally increased. The political regime is living through difficult times as a result of social/economi discontent. This is precisely why, they changed the election dates, so to prevent organising and political maturity of the society. Now, by going against a few of their supporters in 4-5 constituencies they are trying to do damage control. This is why, it is important to focus on the legal violations rather than political results. Overall, without finishing the struggle on legal violations discussing the results of the election from a political point of view, does not really help with protection of democratic freedoms. Basically, the election were held in an emergency rule, with mass police intervention. An adeqaute response to this situation would be pursuing legal proceedings and public shaming. In short, legal disputing play an irriplaceble role in the process of losing confidence and political influence of the authoritarian regimes.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Anar Mammadli (also spelled Mammadov) heads the Election Monitoring and Democracy Studies Centre, the only independent election observation organisation in the country.

As mentioned earlier, when the decision to hold the snap election was announced there was some sense of hope that indeed, new faces (alas not many) would be allowed to enter into the parliament. Azerbaijani society is increasingly angry at economic stagnation and recent investigations exposing official corruption.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, there has been some internal political reshuffling. Two months ahead of calling for the snap election, Ramiz Mehdiyev,\u00a0the powerful head of presidential administration and a Soviet-era apparatchik, was dismissed from his post. As political analyst Farid Guliyev <a href=\"https://neweasterneurope.eu/2020/02/07/from-government-reshuffle-to-snap-parliamentary-elections-political-renewal-in-azerbaijan/\">explained</a> for New Eastern Europe journal:</p>\n</div>\n<blockquote><p>The Mehdiyev-linked group (also known as the \u201cold guard\u201d) is dominated by people from the Nakhchivan region, and includes the former Minister of Internal Affairs Ramil Usubov and ex-presidential advisor Ali Hasanov, all appointed by [Ilham] Aliyev's father, [Heydar Aliyev]. The \u201cold guard\u201d was considered one of the key factions in Aliyev\u2019s ruling coalition. Its power could only be rivalled by the rising influence of the first lady Mehriban Aliyeva\u2019s Pashayev group. The first lady-linked Pashayev group and its business conglomerate Pasha Holding have grown stronger over the past decade. The popular view is that Aliyeva holds ambitions to become the nation\u2019s first woman president. In 2016, the constitution was amended to establish the post of the vice presidency and the following year she was appointed as the first vice president.</p>\n<p>As \u201cold guard\u201d officials were dismissed, they were immediately replaced by younger, seemingly technocratic cadres. For example, Mehdiyev was replaced in his post by a 44-year-old Duke University graduate named Samir Nuriyev. Another American-educated official, Mikail Jabbarov, was appointed as the new minister of the economy, having previously held other ministerial posts.</p>\n<p>Some country observers interpreted these changes as a gathering momentum for reform, a shift of power from the \u201cold guard\u201d to the emerging group of young cadres (dubbed \u201ctechnocratic reformers\u201d). Some pundits evoked the model of \u201cauthoritarian modernisation\u201d.</p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>The average Azerbaijani citizen does not care for these political games among the elite, but about something much more fundamental: whether they are heard.

Buildings collapsed and people were caught under the wreckage. The earthquake also affected the densely forested <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pic_Macaya\">Pic Macaya</a>, the nearby national park named after the country's second-highest mountain, causing landslides. Up until <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/20-adults-4-children-pulled-alive-rubble-week-after-deadly-haiti-earthquake-1622074\">a week ago</a>, there were ongoing rescue operations to find survivors in that area.</p>\n<p>Beyond many of the headlines\u2019 disaster narratives, however, and despite the country's recent <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2021/07/07/will-president-moises-assassination-bring-stability-or-unleash-even-more-chaos-in-haiti/\">political</a>, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&amp;cx=011500527032809623408:sdts3bo1lzs&amp;q=https://globalvoices.org/2021/02/15/president-jovenel-moise-always-seems-to-land-on-his-feet-but-what-about-haiti/&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjvpffq5NbyAhVJRjABHQy-D-AQFnoECAYQAg&amp;usg=AOvVaw3WgKpUcMbYoKYuoUCYAcDr\">social and economic</a> upheaval, life goes on in Haiti. It always does.</p>\n\n<p>The 2021 earthquake, which was more intense than its <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/specialcoverage/2010-special-coverage/haiti-earthquake-2010/\">2010 predecessor</a>, has thus far killed over 2,200 Haitians and left many more injured, missing and homeless. It has also put many Haitians in the position of not having access to food, but a local p\u00e2tisserie, J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Breadfruit Flour and Bakery, has stepped in to help. Since the disaster, it has been providing tasty and nutritious meals, including breads and <a href=\"https://haitian-recipes.com/konparet/\">konpar\u00e8ts</a>, to the town's residents\u2014close to 22,000 in the week after the earthquake alone.</p>\n<p>A dense bread with a cake-like consistency that is a traditional J\u00e9r\u00e9mie delicacy, konpar\u00e8ts are both tasty and filling\u2014but the bakery, which owner Pierre Mo\u00efse Louis established just five years ago, has been baking a very special type of konpar\u00e8ts using breadfruit flour. Although his business was also affected by the earthquake, Louis donated the bakery's salvageable stock to local families in need.</p>\n\n<p>Konpar\u00e8t baking is a <a href=\"https://www.treesthatfeed.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/100-years-of-Konparet-in-Jeremie-by-Bette-Magloire-002.pdf\">century-old tradition</a>. The delicacy is typically made using root ginger, extract of bergamot, vanilla, almonds, cinnamon, star anise, cloves, grated coconut, cane syrup, baking soda, butter, animal fat, a pinch of salt, and well \u2026 flour. So where do the breadfruit trees come in?</p>\n<p>The United States-based not-for-profit <a href=\"https://www.treesthatfeed.org/\">Trees That Feed Foundation</a>, which was <a href=\"https://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20201024/sharing-breadfruit-world-jcan-duo-behind-trees-feed-foundation-works-create#slideshow-1\">co-founded</a> by Jamaicans Mary and Mike McLaughlin, has been donating breadfruit trees to Haiti for the past 10 years. Wanting \u201cfood to be used by Haitians, for Haitians,\u201d the programme encourages the development of other breadfruit products. As the donated trees flourished, locals began to turn the fruit into flour and\u2014at least in Louis\u2019 case\u2014bake konpar\u00e8ts with it. Partnering with Trees That Feed, his bakery has been producing thousands of buns each month to supply schools, children\u2019s homes, and other organisations in need, even before the earthquake. J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Breadfruit Flour and Bakery also runs cooking classes that teach people how to use breadfruit flour in their dishes, and encourages local entrepreneurship.</p>\n\n<p>Of the post-earthquake efforts, Louis says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We are focusing on konpar\u00e8ts because [they are] very nutritious and ready to eat, so people don\u2019t need to cook. People in J\u00e9r\u00e9mie are living on the streets now because their houses were destroyed and, because of the aftershocks of the earthquake, they are afraid to enter the [remaining] houses, which are not still solid. They don\u2019t have any food and water, so they need ready-to-eat foods, because they don\u2019t have kitchens [in which] to cook.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Trees That Feed Foundation is a major partner in the <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2021/07/17/caribbean-tree-planting-week-a-region-wide-coalition-gets-serious-about-climate-change-action/\">Caribbean Tree Planting Project</a> (CTPP), an initiative spearheaded by the <a href=\"https://cariphilalliance.org/\">Caribbean Philanthropic Alliance</a> (CariPhilAlliance) that is taking place across 22 regional territories.</p>\n<p>The first Caribbean Tree Planting Week took place in July this year, but since February 2020, the CTPP has planted more than 1.5 million trees across the Caribbean, most of them in Haiti. Its next goal is to plant two million trees between July 2021 and June 2022, region-wide.</p>\n<p>In addition to other activities, the CariPhilAlliance and Trees That Feed are working together to help expand the bakery\u2019s production of konpar\u00e8ts:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In addition to being flavourful, these baked goods are made with breadfruit which is rich in iron, potassium, vitamin A, and other vitamins and minerals. These meals are also made from coconut, ginger, and molasses which provide protein, iron, potassium, antioxidants and other nutrients. A single breadfruit tree has been found to produce enough fruit to feed an entire family, and can live up to 80-100 years, providing entrepreneurs in Haiti with professional opportunities for years to come.</p></blockquote>\n</div>", "comments": [{"id": "5821", "news_id": 341, "fallacy": "none", "comment": "This is great but what happens when the food is not enough?

Just one kilometer from the nearest inhabited village and four kilometers from the nearest town, citizens worry that the mining will wipe out entire livelihoods and poses severe environmental risks to the health and well-being of communities in south-eastern Macedonia.</p>\n\n<p>In a single day in 2012, <a href=\"http://www.copin.mk/en/projects\">COPIN (through Sardich MC)\u00a0</a>secured three mining concession signatures out of a total of <a href=\"http://time.mk/c/c0aea14606/pesevski-potpisal-86-koncesii-za-rudnici-vo-eden-den-vo-2012-godina.html\">86 signed by the former Macedonian government,</a>\u00a0under the right-wing political party VMRO-DPMNE. This party ruled from August 2006 to May 2017 and credible allegations of massive corruption played a major part in its downfall from power.</p>\n<p>All 86 mining concessions are located in south-eastern Macedonia, a bastion of fertile lands with inhabited cities and villages where the local population lives off agriculture and serves as the majority provider of fruits and vegetables in the country.</p>\n\n<p>Out of the three mining concessions, the Kazandol copper and gold mine is currently in the last phases of construction and is prepping to begin exploitation. So far, locals have voted \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 to the mines in six referendums, organized in regions affected by the mining operations.</p>\n<p>An overwhelming majority voted against the mines while other areas had low voter turn out or could not reach the necessary consensus vote.

In the small town of <a href=\"http://meta.mk/en/valandovo-will-hold-a-referendum-over-the-kazandol-mine/\">Valandovo</a>\u00a0where many protested the mines, its referendum ultimately did not reach the necessary census to make it legitimate, with 300 missing votes.</p>\n<h3>Mining poses potentially disastrous environmental and social threats</h3>\n\n<p>The Kazandol mining complex will span across 287 hectares of land now covered with forests and shrubs. Ore mining will be carried out by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-pit_mining\">open-pit method</a>. Digging of the mine will be done by blasts and explosions and the copper and gold will be separated from the rock using on-site pools with sulfuric acid. The <a href=\"http://www.copin.mk/images/download/documents/EN/SardichMC_EIA_EN.pdf\">Study on Environmental Impact Assessment: Mine Complex Kazandol, Valandovo, Macedonia</a> clearly states:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The heap leaching of the raw mineral shall be carried out in a dump of the excavated copper ore. The technology that shall be used for obtaining the final product \u2013 electrolytic (cathode) copper, is based on the use of low concentration (0.5%) solution of sulfuric acid-heap leaching solution, which shall be sprinkled (sprayed) on the surface of the dump. Crossing through the deposited raw mineral on the dump, the solution dilutes a part of the copper from the ore and runs from its lower part.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Three sulfuric acid tanks each with 270 cubic meters will exist on the site along with an organic diluents reservoir. The study presents harmful results such as air pollution from acid fumes, dust emissions from mining activities and emissions of gas from trucks and cars associated with the complex. This was illustrated on 13 December 2017 when Sardich MC ran test blasts on the Kazandol mining complex.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"sr\">\u0412\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e \u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0443 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0438 \u043e\u0434 \u043f\u0440\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043a\u0443\u045c\u0438 \u0432\u043e \u0441. \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0434\u043e\u043b \u0438 \u0441.\u0411\u0440\u0430\u0458\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0446\u0438<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%97%D0%B0%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#\u0421\u0442\u043e\u043f\u0417\u0430\u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0434\u043e\u043b</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/4wjiosyWsI\">pic.twitter.com/4wjiosyWsI</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 \u041c\u0430\u0458\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442 (@majstor_baki) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/majstor_baki/status/941014993721593857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 13, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"translation\"><p><strong>Tweet: </strong>This is how the first blasting looked like, only few meters from the first houses of the villages of Kazandol and Brajkovci. #StopForKazandol\n<strong>Video captions:</strong> First blasting at Kazandol Mine. 4-5 such explosions are planned on daily basis during the next 15 years.

Nur Nahar Begum lives with her four children and husband in informal dwellings next to the Karnaphuli River. She was forced to migrate to the city from Laxmipur, a low-lying southeast coastal district after she lost her home in 2019 to river erosion.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2022GL098477\">Chittagong</a> has been identified as one of the coastal cities in Asia subsiding at a rate almost <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-28/climate-change-flood-risks-get-worse-for-sinking-cities\">10 times faster</a> than the sea level is rising. Similar to Manila in the Philippines, it has sunk by as much as 20 mm per year over a 5-year period, from 2015 to 2020.</p>\n<p>The city, often touted as the country\u2019s commercial capital, also has a groundwater extraction problem. Before 2010, the Chittagong Water Supply and Sewage Authority (CWASA) was able to supply only <a href=\"https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-102306\">190 million litres per day</a> (MLD), not even half the city\u2019s required water supply of 500 MLD. Out of this 190 MLD, 100 MLD was taken from underground aquifers.</p>\n<p>But CWASA chief engineer Maksud Alam said they have tried to switch to surface water through various projects. Since 2017, 92 percent of the city\u2019s water needs have been sourced from surface water. \u201cWe are trying to [be] solely dependent on surface water, realizing the problems,\u201d he said in an interview with Unbias The News.</p>\n<p>The transition has not been smooth, however. The country\u2019s commercial hub, home to over 1,200 major industries such as steel and cement, continues to grapple with diminishing sources of water overall. Factories and enterprises found it difficult to get water even after \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thedailystar.net/backpage/news/industrial-belt-ctgs-sitakunda-factories-hit-water-crisis-1773607\">drilling 1,500 \u2013 2,000 feet into the ground</a>.\u201d As a result, other companies like steel manufacturing company GPH Ispat Ltd have resorted to constructing their own dams to meet the water demand of both their operations and employees. While this was a temporary remedy, it has affected the capacity of ethnic minorities to get their own water in the area, as <a href=\"https://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/news/dam-makeshift-damage-extensive-1735903\">reported</a> by The Daily Star.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh/thirsty-ctg-industries-dry-water-level-261475\">thirsty</a> industries have been accused of indiscriminately extracting groundwater as other sources such as the River Kharnapuli have <a href=\"https://www.tbsnews.net/environment/rising-karnaphuli-salinity-spells-disaster-industries-132448\">become</a> more saline. People have <a href=\"https://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh/locals-hold-protest-blame-bsrm-factory-groundwater-depletion-mirsharai-253312\">protested</a> against this, saying the continued extraction of private companies has cut their own supply of water, which they use for irrigation and drinking.</p>\n<p>Professor Muhammad Rashidul Hasan, head of the urban and regional planning department at Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology told Unbias The News:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If industries continue to extract water in such a manner, there will be a huge catastrophe due to land subsiding. Already in many adjacent areas, agricultural lands are not getting water because of the extraction of the industries.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sans any intervention, this competition over groundwater between industries and <a href=\"https://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh/locals-hold-protest-blame-bsrm-factory-groundwater-depletion-mirsharai-253312\">Chittagong\u2019s residents</a> is only expected to worsen with the planned establishment of the largest industrial zone in the country, the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Shilpa Nagar (BSMSN). \u201cMore than 580 industries, including garments, automobiles, food, and the chemical industry, are expected to be established there,\u201d a <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362021710_Potential_Impacts_of_Industrialization_on_Coastal_Fresh_Groundwater_Resources_in_Bangladesh\">study</a> conducted by Prof. Mahfuzur Khan from the University of Dhaka and other experts noted. \u201cTo run this industrial site every day, approximately 839 million litres/day of freshwater will be required by 2040, which will be collected from nearby surface water sources and groundwater,\u201d it added.</p>\n<p>To try to mitigate the sourcing of water through extraction, however, the government is looking into a <a href=\"https://www.tbsnews.net/economy/industry/pipe-water-meghna-quench-bangabandhu-shilpa-nagars-thirst-489738\">project</a> that will bring 900 MLD from the River Meghna to the planned industrial zone. This move is critical. As Khan et al\u2019s study noted, aside from the industrial sector and the city\u2019s residents fighting over scarce water, having companies rely massively on groundwater extraction poses a greater risk of seawater intrusion and land subsidence.</p>\n\n<p>As it is, seawater intrusion has already been a serious problem in Chittagong. The findings of <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2673-4834/2/1/10/htm?fbclid=IwAR2obUNNdpvwpBRNJ7f5IOEM5f0VVLDHbieuzY2mpczMvOaTUzvII9kqFz4#B22-earth-02-00010\">this study</a> published in the journal Earth showed that most commuters lived on the coast, which is at the most 5 meters above sea level. Over the years they have tried to deal with seawater intrusion by barricading the entrances, elevating their floors, and raising the roads.</p>\n<p>Agrabad, home to both local and international businesses and financial institutions, as well as to Chittagong\u2019s wealthy families, is not spared from this problem. \u201cAgrabad CDA Residential Area was the first and posh residential area in Chittagong. People came from all over Chittagong to see the modern residential area built by CDA [Chittagong Development Authority] in the heart of the Bangladesh commercial city in the 1960s,\u201d said Architect-Environmental Planner Reza Kaiser, former chief city planner of Chittagong City Corporation (CCC). Kaiser added:</p>\n<blockquote><p>All the ground floor of this posh residential area is now almost abandoned due to its constant inundation by saline water whenever there are high tides in the Bay of Bengal.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Kaiser had identified Agrabad as a high-risk area for flooding in his book \u2018Climate change and its consequences on Chattogram (Chittagong) city of Bangladesh.\u2019 CDA Chief Engineer Kazi Hasan Bin Shams shared: \u201cWe are struggling with the situation. We elevated roads by three feet in 2019 spending millions of money but the tidal surge won again as it flooded the whole area this year. This is due to increasing sea level rise and some unplanned development.\u201d</p>\n<h4>The search for alternatives</h4>\n<p>CWASA has developed <a href=\"http://ctg-wasa.org.bd/site/page/30142c98-2010-4771-be08-c293d01ed550/-\">four projects</a> in 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2015, with the <a href=\"http://ctg-wasa.org.bd/site/page/4ca0bb44-fcda-42f4-9df7-4bb779b6abc7/-\">Bhandal-Juri water Supply Project</a> scheduled to be completed this year. All in all, CWASA was able to increase the water capacity of Chittagong from 190 MLD to 500 MLD in a decade. \u201cWe hope soon we will go into the operation of the Bhandal-Juri project that will produce 45 MLD, and we will be turning to 100 percent surface water. However, we are facing some difficulties in some plants due to increasing salinity,\u201d said AKM Fazullah, managing director of CWASA. CWASA is treating the water of the Halda River and Karnaphuli River. DWASA is treating water from the Shitalakhya and Padma Rivers.</p>\n<p>Prior to this, CWASA implemented three water treatment projects costing roughly USD 655 million from three foreign lenders \u2014 Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica), the World Bank, and the Exim Bank of South Korea. CWASA has to start their repayment in 2023 and has to pay around <a href=\"https://www.tbsnews.net/economy/chattogram-wasa-creaks-under-debt-load-398018\">USD 29 million annually</a>. DWASA\u2019s debt to the foreign lenders, on the other hand, is roughly USD 2 billion and every year they have to repay around BDT 400 crore to BDT 600 crore or USD 47 million to USD 71 million.</p>\n<p>CWASA has reportedly passed the burden of paying these debts to the consumers through water tariffs, even if some of the projects did not allegedly deliver the intended results.</p>\n<h4>Factoring in climate change</h4>\n<p>Bangladesh is increasing the climate allocation in its national budget every year.

During heavy rainfall, they act as drainage channels for flowing water that starts in the central highlands of the island and moves towards the coast.</p>\n<p>Over one-third of the island's plant species \u2014 like the native Macaw palm (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiphanes_minima\">Aiphanes minima</a>) which is distinguished by its spiny trunk, and the Bearded Fig tree (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficus_citrifolia\">Ficus citrifolia</a>) \u2014 can be found growing in the lush, green forests of gullies.</p>\n\n<p>Such rich vegetation provides both food and habitat for wildlife species like the green monkey (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_monkey\">Chlorocebus sabaeus</a>) and the yellow-banded millipede (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anadenobolus_monilicornis\">Anadenobolus monilicornis</a>).</p>\n<p>Reptiles like lizards and the endangered Barbados threadsnake (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados_threadsnake\">Tetracheilostoma carlae</a>), the world\u2019s smallest snake, can also be found in these gullies. Endemic to the island, this snake primarily inhabits forested areas, which are few and far between, as the island has no original forest left, most of it having been cleared for agricultural purposes. While the species is elusive, <a href=\"https://www.welchmanhallgullybarbados.com/\">Welchman Hall Gully</a> is one area where it can be found; it is believed they also exist in other areas with similar conditions.</p>\n<p>Given that gullies are difficult areas to develop, they now preserve many of the island\u2019s native plant species and, as such, are some of the last remaining refuges for native species like the Barbados threadsnake.</p>\n<p>Further to their ecosystem functions, the vegetation in gullies contributes to carbon sequestration and regulates the flow of water by allowing it to slow down and infiltrate the ground. This process replenishes the island\u2019s aquifers and reduces soil erosion. Gullies also contain rich biological resources, which can be used for traditional medicines, biomedical research, and animal foods.</p>\n<p>Gullies also hold cultural and historical significance. Studies by archaeologists Frederick H. Smith and Hayden F. Bassett found that during plantation slavery, gullies served as pathways between estates for the enslaved, allowing them to travel without being seen by estate owners.</p>\n<p>Archaeological evidence, like artefacts found in the gullies in St. Nicholas Abbey, also shows that caves located in the gullies were once used as social gathering areas or for the purpose of relaying information, allowing enslaved people to have their own spaces, hidden away from those dominated by the planter class.</p>\n<h3>Issues affecting Barbados\u2019 gullies</h3>\n<p>Indiscriminate waste disposal and rapid land-use changes have threatened the ecological well-being of Barbados\u2019 gullies. Illegal dumping is one of the main issues affecting these areas, and the battle to stop this activity has been ongoing for many years.</p>\n<p>Old household appliances \u2014 fridges, furniture and construction rubble \u2014 and dead livestock are among the types of waste found indiscriminately dumped in gullies across the island. In addition to the harm this kind of waste can cause to wildlife, gully pollution also affects the quality of life in nearby communities.</p>\n<p>Pollution facilitates conditions for pests like rodents, flies and mosquitoes to thrive, which increases the risk of disease. It also increases the likelihood of flooding, as the physical barrier created by solid waste and debris in waterways can, and often does, dam flowing water during heavy rainfall.</p>\n<p>One such incident <a href=\"https://www.nationnews.com/2021/08/31/flooding-west-coast-reminds-residents-1995/\">occurred</a> in 1995, when there was the breakdown of a barrier in a gully in Weston, in the parish of St. James along Barabados'west coast. Popular calypsonian Neville Denis Blackman, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxVD0Nfkqg8\">known by</a> the sobriquet \u201cDe Great Carew,\u201d died during the flooding.</p>\n<p>In addition to solid waste, chemical runoff from agriculture also affects gullies\u2019 well-being. Throw the introduction of invasive species and deforestation into the mix and the true scope of the threat to Barbados\u2019 gullies begins to be seen.</p>\n<h3>Conserving gullies</h3>\n<p>Over time, national campaigns to clean up gullies have become a regular activity in Barbados, with non-governmental organisations and volunteers often gathering to clean the gullies, which are most affected by illegal dumping.</p>\n<p>In 2022, the Barbados Defence Force, Coast Guard and other such entities <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CleanUpBIM/posts/pfbid0pdQZmxahE18bAxuXfr5gwF48R1ZW563uAUTs5n4mGW6GRSXKkU4YLRJwA8cJ516Dl?__cft__[0]=AZUvuSi_ZO8X3Bi0obS2pkkcvj1GhITTGzTA4O97MSAZwqIdmFUocbd3AUOvNy1ScAFp9UiWIl-Sp2_nGTmjHGed7pWaIpqapqqO6xMegAyVvpTjpkUKHFo8Q9br4xhExbAhXuwzrGk_CqzPSiyRFsuzURH48IoYwfEphVrJhhXdl4hjBzgG4P-2a46fyap7m534M3YuHRE7FzoSpXxOf3SErnq9lwF07lGB9pX1F2lveU8e1bgWvC2puMl0QlkTXcjnlYv-jXnrhDAzdUI7YBDr&amp;__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R\">collaborated</a> for a cleanup of <a href=\"https://barbadostoday.bb/2022/05/07/garbage-by-the-tonnes/\">Bucks Gully</a>, St. Thomas, in the centre of the island, where an estimated 66,000 pounds of garbage was collected.</p>\n<p>Other proactive conservation approaches include the creation, in 2005, of the <a href=\"https://www.cbd.int/countries/profile/?country=bb\">Integrated Gully Ecosystem Management Plan</a> (IGEMP) by the then Ministry of Energy and the Environment. The plan sought to build public awareness of gullies through education, by making it part of the school curriculum and educating farmers on how the chemicals they use affect gullies.</p>\n<p>The IGEMP also outlined policies for gullies which prevent deforestation, promote natural reforestation, and enforce a three-metre, no-development buffer zone around gullies. However, the 15-year-old plan is now dated, and there are debates on its effectiveness.</p>\n<p>Still, education is key if the protection of gullies is to be successful, as illegal dumping remains one of the main threats. While it is difficult to consistently monitor illegal dumping, efforts to reduce this habit heavily rely on the awareness of surrounding communities to make decisions with gullies in mind.</p>\n</div>", "comments": [{"id": "7414", "news_id": 472, "fallacy": "hasty generalization", "comment": "People in general are horrible to the environment.

They have their own traditions and customs. They are integrated into the Kyrgyz society through local culture and interethnic marriages with Kyrgyz and other ethnicities.</p>\n<p>Here is a YouTube video about the life of Koreans in Kyrgyzstan.</p>\n\n<p>Their integration has become more complex as some started converting to Islam in the early 2000s. The six personal stories shared by \u201cUmma\u201d showcase this trend. All six men changed their names to fit their new identities. This name change has some precedence \u2014 Soviet authorities forced <a href=\"https://ru.sputnik.kg/20181211/korejcy-kyrgyzstan-1042378175.html\">Koreans to change their names</a> to Russian ones after their relocation to Central Asia in 1937.</p>\n<p>Here is the YouTube video by Umma about how Koreans converted to Islam in Kyrgyzstan.</p>\n\n<p>Yurii Muhammad Yusuf was the first among them to convert in 2004. His transformation is unbelievable, even to himself. \u201cIf someone told me in the early 2000s that I would read the Quran in Arabic, I would have replied that it was impossible and fantasy,\u201d he says.</p>\n<p>Their motivations for converting are different. Abdulvahid, formerly Vladimir, became Muslim in 2008 after his close Russian friend died after converting to Islam. After his friend had converted, he was the only non-Muslim in their three men friend group consisting of a Kyrgyz, Russian, and Korean person. He shares: \u201cI took it [friend\u2019s death] as a sign. Allah was telling me not to be late [to convert to Islam].\u201d He adds, \u201cAllah told me to be his servant, and I agreed.\u201d</p>\n<p>Four of them found answers to their questions about the meaning of life in Islam. Muhammad Ali shares that he converted to Islam to better deal with the voices inside his head. He believes he was possessed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinn\">jinn</a>, evil spirits. Within a year after his conversion to Islam, the voices disappeared, and his life returned to normal.</p>\n<p>They confess about being worried about the reactions of their friends and family to their decisions. Solih confessed: \u201cI was anxious about what other people would say about my conversion to Islam.\u201d In some cases, as it was with Muhammad Ali and Solih, their family members supported them and also converted. For Yurii Muhammad, it was different, and he had to cobble together a new support system. \u201cAllah changed my family,\u201d he explained, noting that he remarried and started a new family.</p>\n<p>Their conversion is also the result of the re-Islamization of Kyrgyzstan, which started in 1991 after Kyrgyzstan gained independence. This process has led to an explosion in the <a href=\"https://daryo.uz/ru/2023/03/11/v-kyrgyzstane-vozvedut-samuu-bolsuu-v-strane-mecet-na-20-tysac-celovek#:~:text=%D0%A1%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%BE%20%D1%88%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%20%D0%B8%20%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%B9%20%D0%B2,669%20%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%B9%20%D0%B8%20125%20%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%B5.\">number of mosques and madrasas</a> (Islamic religious institutions), from 38 mosques and zero madrasas in 1991 to 2,699 mosques and 125 madrasas in 2023.

In the past, we truly never had any idea of the promises these political parties made with us before we got them elected. If you go back and read their manifestos, you will be shocked how good those manifestos were and how bad they have been at their job by not following their own book. These manifestos are truly filled with such great plans to help our country prosper that if we stick to it, it's going to be truly fruitful for our country. This is why I thought at least this new guy brought so much HOPE due to his image that he should be pushed to stick to the book.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>GV: Is there any political agenda or aim behind it?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>SS:</strong> The kind of family I am from, politics has always been the least favorite of all fields. There isn\u2019t any political agenda behind the initiative but one thing I have felt after developing this is that I can possibly help the new governance use my digital skills and help them develop tools to make sure their whole governance is being monitored for their performance and tasks. In simple words, I can help the new government in the civil services reforms they talk about.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>GV: How resourceful will it be for the general public?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>SS:\u00a0</strong>The general public has been loving it so far since I bring the whole agenda to them in a more user-friendly way. As everyone has not read the 100 Days Agenda or Manifesto of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf. So this is really resourceful in the sense of educating them about what has been promised and how good the new governance is sticking to it.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>GV: How have people responded? Have they engaged?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>SS:\u00a0</strong>At first people believed that I had a political agenda but slowly they have understood the whole objective here. People from overseas as well as in the country have been emailing appreciating the effort and offering if they can help in any way possible.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>GV: What do you aim once the 100 days are over?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>SS:\u00a0</strong>If I get any proper support to continue it for the coming five years, I actually plan to continue it for the complete five years and then also do the same for the past 10 years and compare all the three parties on their performance by comparing the promises they completed and the standing of Pakistan in certain indicators used by global organisations to study a country\u2019s standing.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>GV: Has anyone contacted you from Imran Khan's party?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>SS:</strong> No, no one has contacted me yet.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>GV: How do you collect your data?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>SS:\u00a0</strong>I am keeping my eyes on the PTI accounts since they post every action that their new governance takes. Plus I keep my eyes on the news websites like Dawn and e-Tribune for each new action that take and compare it with their promised and how it affects them.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>GV: Will this strengthen democracy?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>SS:\u00a0</strong>I think it already has. The Khan Meter has been a good addition to the reform of true democracy in Pakistan. This is a unique incident that someone who is a fan of the new government because of their image is not going to sit on the sidelines and be blind like the people have been for past so many years. It\u2019s time to start monitoring our government, discuss where they went wrong as well as appreciate what they did right. It helps us think logically about the new government\u2019s performance since we will be able to see that they couldn\u2019t perform in just 20 percent of their promises and so we can give them credit for the successful 80 percent.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>GV: Any message for our audience?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>SS:</strong> Start holding your bodies accountable question their work, words, and attitude as they are public servants.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Khan Meter offers hope</h3>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Just like ObamaMeter , <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/KhanMeter?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#KhanMeter</a> introduced to monitor performance of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ImranKhanPTI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ImranKhanPTI</a> .? lets see what <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/KHANMETER?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#KHANMETER</a> will look like after some time. <a href=\"https://t.co/so4jhZm5Bw\">pic.twitter.com/so4jhZm5Bw</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Ali Raza Sherazi (@AliSherazi1990) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AliSherazi1990/status/1032862573010591744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 24, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Fantastic!

Saakashvili fled Georgia shortly thereafter, and was <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-georgia-saakashvili-verdict/georgian-ex-president-sentenced-in-absentia-for-abuse-of-power-idUSKBN1EU1DC\">sentenced by a Georgian court</a> of abuse of power in 2018 on charges widely considered politically motivated.</p>\n<p>Ivanishvili sought to distance himself from his predecessor as far as possible. That wasn't difficult. Saakashvili, an American-educated lawyer, has quite a different background from Ivanishvili, whose fortune, estimated at $5.4 billion, was largely earned in Russia. For the people of Tbilisi, his glass mansion towering above the historic district of Sololaki is a daily reminder of the influence he enjoys in this South Caucasus state of 3.7 million.</p>\n<p>In recent years, that influence has become a subject of great contention. Despite a brief stint as prime minister in 2012-13, Ivanishvili's power has largely been informal or exercised through his chairmanship of Georgian Dream, a role he has occupied and renounced several times. Georgia has had many prime ministers since Ivanishvili left that post, and it has not gone unnoticed that his four successors and several current and former government ministers have had close business and personal ties to the billionaire, particularly via his former company CARTU management. This situation is now being <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tigeorgia/videos/562029637894542/\">described by Transparency International Georgia</a> as one of \u201cstate capture.\u201d</p>\n<p>The year 2019 has been one of the rockiest for Georgian Dream's rule. In late June, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48710042\">mass protests broke out</a> when the Russian politician Georgy Gavrilov was invited to address the Georgian parliament. Given that Russian troops are present on 20 per cent of Georgian territory, in the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, it was a provocative move. Police\u00a0<a href=\"https://eurasianet.org/violent-crackdown-throws-georgian-ruling-partys-survival-into-question\">responded with a violent crackdown</a> in which several of the 20,000 protesters lost their eyes after being shot with rubber bullets. The symbolism was important; Georgian Dream had come to power on a wave of popular anger at the increasingly heavy-handed rule of the UNM government, particularly its violent repression of a protest in Tbilisi in 2007. Now, it seemed to be following their lead.</p>\n<p>The UNM's line, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SaakashviliMikheil/videos/457987254824450/\">articulated by Saakashvili</a> from his European exile, is that Ivanishvili is pro-Russia and therefore a threat to Georgian sovereignty. A <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/11/26/democracy-georgia-is-heading-crunch-is-west-paying-attention/\">softer version of this argument</a> holds that such heavy handed rule inherently follows a Russian model. The tenor of the criticism and the leanings of the critics may differ, but several observers of Georgian politics told GlobalVoices that they felt Ivanishvili had overreached in consolidating control of Georgian politics, triggering a backlash.</p>\n<p>Ghia Nodia, director of the International School for Political Science at Ilia State University in Tbilisi, stressed the geopolitical aspect:</p>\n<blockquote><p>This crisis was started by cheating, Ivanishvili is seen as a person who played a trick on the people. This means he cannot be considered a trustworthy person (not that he was really trusted before, but this time he crossed another important red line). On the other hand, he is prepared to do anything to maintain power. [The opposition] also did not know what exactly to do to counter Ivanishvili\u2019s unexpected move. This was a recipe to radicalization: the strategy appears to be to discredit Ivanishvili further. The Russian factor is also very prominent in the discussion. Ivanishvili is seen as somebody who is bringing Georgia closer to Russia. This means making Georgia more autocratic, that is Russia-like; but this also means that Ivanishvili has alienated the West and is indeed more isolated than ever before \u2013 which means that this moves him closer to Putin\u2019s Russia also in a geopolitical sense.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Kornely Kakachia, Professor of Political Science at Ivane Javakhishvili State University in Tbilisi, stressed the personal nature of the confrontation. Ivanishvili's rivalry with Saakashvili, he says, has escalated into a dangerous zero-sum game:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Due to the highly polarised nature of Georgian politics and Ivanishvili's personal feud with Saakashvili, both consider that they can't afford to lose an election. At the end of the day, this is about survival not only of the regime, but of his personal wealth, security, and privileges. So when he promised proportional representation under pressure, he miscalculated. He's now calculating his chances more carefully. But Georgian Dream is very eclectic, a marriage of convenience which almost collapsed without his financial support. I think it's too late for him, and he thinks that by demonising Saakashvili and the UNM he can still cling onto power. But he's lost a lot of credibility, and unlike his predecessors, he doesn't know how to leave with grace.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This confrontation is perhaps why Georgian Dream politicians and their supporters have often presented the protests in the capital as nothing more than an attempt by the disgraced UNM government to return to power outside the ballot box. Some participants emphasised to Global Voices that while UNM supporters are present on the streets, the movement is diverse, including libertarians, social democrats, socialists, and neo-nationalists.</p>\n<p>Grigol Gegelia, a historian and politician from Lelo, a recently founded centrist party in Georgia, told GlobalVoices that the country \u201chad a chance to adopt a progressive, inclusive electoral system which would have enabled our feeble democracy to move beyond the two-party dichotomy which has harmed our political culture in radical ways.\u201d This was not, stressed Gegelia, a \u201cMishist\u201d (Georgian term used for supporters of Saakashvili \u2014 ed.) movement.</p>\n<p>Similarly, some commentators disillusioned with Georgian Dream are no less disturbed by Saakashvili's seeming ability to regard every political protest in Georgia as a referendum on his return:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u10e8\u10d4\u10d5\u10ee\u10d4\u10d3\u10dd\u10d7 \u10d5\u10d8\u10dc \u10d0\u10e0\u10d8\u10e1 \u201e\u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10e3\u10da\u10d8 \u10dd\u10ea\u10dc\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8\u10e1\u201c \u10d0\u10da\u10e2\u10d4\u10e0\u10dc\u10d0\u10e2\u10d8\u10d5\u10d0?! \u10db\u10d4 \u10d0\u10e0\u10ea \u10d8\u10e1 \u10db\u10d8\u10dc\u10d3\u10d0, \u10e0\u10dd\u10db \u10d4\u10e1\u10d4\u10dc\u10d8 \u10e1\u10d0\u10db\u10e3\u10d3\u10d0\u10db\u10dd\u10d3 \u10d3\u10d0\u10e0\u10e9\u10dc\u10d4\u10dc \u10d3\u10d0 \u10d0\u10e0\u10ea \u10d8\u10e1 \u10db\u10d8\u10dc\u10d3\u10d0, \u10e0\u10dd\u10db \u201e\u10d8\u10e1\u10d8\u10dc\u10d8\u201c \u10db\u10dd\u10d1\u10e0\u10e3\u10dc\u10d3\u10dc\u10d4\u10dc. \u10d0\u10da\u10e2\u10d4\u10e0\u10dc\u10d0\u10e2\u10d8\u10d5\u10d0 \u10e3\u10dc\u10d3\u10d0 \u10e8\u10d4\u10d8\u10e5\u10db\u10dc\u10d0\u10e1 \u10e1\u10d0\u10d6\u10dd\u10d2\u10d0\u10d3\u10dd\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8\u10e1 \u10ec\u10d8\u10d0\u10e6\u10e8\u10d8.

Beka Natsvlishvili, an independent MP who <a href=\"https://civil.ge/archives/277623\">quit the ruling coalition in February</a>, told Global Voices that his hopes for a more socially-oriented government after the fall of Saakashvili had been dashed:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I hoped that Georgian Dream would change the neoliberal path chosen by Saakashvili. Any of my suggestions in this regard were rejected so I found no reason to stay in the [parliamentary] majority.\u00a0Georgian Dream is a party of power, without any ideology, typical for Georgia and the post-Soviet space. When they lose power, they disappear, because supporters have no reason to stay with [such a party]; it can no longer ensure you a job in the state sector or any other services. This has happened with almost all ruling parties in Georgia. The exception is the United National Movement, because they elaborated an ideology of neoliberalism combined with anti-Russian nationalism.</p>\n<p>Georgian Dream's support is just based on fear that UNM could regain power and take revenge on its opponents. So because Georgian Dream improved the human rights situation, it did almost nothing to improve social rights. We have now neoliberalism with a human face. Because of this dominant discourse, dominant parties offer no real programmes to solve people's problems.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In a country where the average monthly wage is just equivalent to 400 USD, social inequality can easily boil over into political resentment.</p>\n<p>Just as in 2004, when Saakashvili's UNM and its allies toppled the ailing Eduard Shevardnadze in the Rose Revolution, Georgian Dream presented itself as the saviour for a country with a broken social contract.\u00a0And as Georgians seemingly become disillusioned with Georgian Dream, it is unclear who their next saviour will be.\u00a0As the long-term observer Stephen Jones <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/fate-of-georgian-dreams/\">has written</a>, that cycle of salvation and betrayal is the ultimate tragedy of Georgian politics today: \u201cA widening chasm between leaders and led which leads in the end to a popular explosion.\u201d</p>\n</div>", "comments": [{"id": "4721", "news_id": 175, "fallacy": "appeal to authority", "comment": "The article says that 400 usd average income breeds resentment.

Telegram premium allows the subscriber to log in to up to four accounts on the same device, while the free plan only allows three accounts to do so. The maximum number of words on photo and video descriptions for free plan users is 1,024, while the premium account is up to 2,048.

And since the Iranian judiciary moved<a href=\"https://www.article19.org/resources/iran-the-block-on-telegram-in-iran-is-a-blow-to-freedom-of-expression/\"> to censor Telegram</a> at the end of April 2018, a series of policy reforms have drastically changed online controls in Iran.</p>\n<p>Far from its (self-promoted) image as progressive, the Iranian government\u2019s new censorship techniques are \u201cporous\u201d rather than free. While publicly rejecting censorship of Telegram in rhetoric, government leaders have quietly promoted \u201cnational\u201d messaging services, making it increasingly necessary for Iranians to use communication channels under the control of authorities.</p>\n<p>The Iranian government has aggressively pursued development of national messengers for the past four years \u2013 worryingly (amid economic crisis) through Rouhani governmental funds, leading to the development of government-sanctioned services such as Soroush, Bisphone, and Telegram Talaee. These and other applications have existed for years and have been widely distrusted and avoided by Iranians.</p>\n<p>But in recent months, officials have deployed more proactive and even aggressive measures in an effort to promote national services.</p>\n<div class=\"factbox alignright\">\n<p><strong>Telegram in Iran</strong></p>\n<p>Originally created as a platform for secure instant messaging (despite flaws in the service's security), <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2016/12/08/the-thin-line-between-political-censorship-and-fighting-fake-news-in-iran/\">Telegram morphed</a> into a major news source for Iranians after it introduced public channels in September 2015. This was especially significant in Iran, where local news websites and many blocked diaspora media outlets are able to broadcast content freely to Internet users who subscribe to their public channels.</p>\n<p>Telegram is one of the few Western social networks that hasn't been blocked in Iran. Facebook and Twitter, for example, have been banned since 2009.</p>\n</div>\n<p>In early 2017, the Ministry of ICT launched incentives for software developers to create local messaging services to rival Telegram. Grants of approximately\u00a0USD $260,000 were <a href=\"http://techrasa.com/2017/02/25/million-dollar-incentives-local-messaging-apps-iran/\">provided for every one million users</a> a platform attained, as long as the platform complied with Iran\u2019s regulations for messaging services.</p>\n<p>Incentives to create successful messaging platforms, to rival popular foreign platforms that were deemed as uncooperative with local data policies, went into overdrive in 2017. The state began subsidizing connectivity for these apps in late 2017, making it much more affordable for Iranians to use homegrown apps, rather than\u00a0 foreign platforms (see page 9 of March <a href=\"https://www.article19.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/TTN_Internet-controls-during-and-after.pdf\">2018 Tightening the Net</a>). ARTICLE 19 has consistently criticised this process as flagrantly violating international standards on net neutrality.</p>\n<p>In addition to censoring Telegram in April 2018 (it remains accessible via circumvention tools), the government even threatened well-known Telegram users who refused to move to a national alternative. In July 2018, multiple <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/persian/iran-44772301\">administrators of food channels on Telegram</a> were called in for questioning by the authorities and threatened with fines for using VPNs to access Telegram. Authorities threatened to prosecute them if they did not move their channels onto a national alternative, such as Soroush. The channel administrators had previously been forced by the Supreme Council of Cyberspace<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/persian/iran-44772301\"> to register their channels</a> on a government website. They believe the information they provided as part of the registration process was subsequently used to target and threaten them.</p>\n<p>These measures have raised the technical and political costs of using Telegram, thereby leaving Iranians more inclined to use national alternatives.</p>\n<h3>Iran's national messaging platforms</h3>\n<p>The most infamous of the government\u2019s platforms is Soroush. Owned by the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), the messaging and social media application has been promoted by both the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, and ICT Minister Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi for its <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/with-telegram-in-trouble-tehran-tries-to-sell-iranians-on-security-of-homegrown-messaging-apps/29175325.html\">protection of user</a> privacy, despite large amounts of evidence pointing to the contrary.</p>\n<p>Soroush is owned by the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB). If platforms follow the policies set in place by the SCC (see the appendix of the <a href=\"https://www.article19.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Tightening-the-Net_3-English-version-1.pdf\">September 2017 Tightening the Net report</a>), encryption would be banned and all the platform\u2019s data would be accessible to authorities. Initial assessments of Soroush unveiled worrying features, such as the ability to show personal details of channel administrators, including phone numbers and details of their membership of other channels. In April 2018, a mobile application developer shared on Twitter how he could <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MilaDnu/status/981101823997173760\">openly access</a> the user data of the ICT Minister Jahromi, including his telephone number.</p>\n<p>Iranians can only register their Soroush accounts to their Iranian SIM cards (users with SIM cards registered outside of Iran are blocked from using the platform). In 2015, the Communications Regulatory Authority <a href=\"https://financialtribune.com/articles/economy-sci-tech/59911/iran-disables-more-unregistered-sim-cards\">established a policy</a> that all SIM cards in Iran must be registered to a national ID and residential address, making anonymity impossible for any activity that requires SIM registration. Throughout May 2018, many Iranian users <a href=\"https://twitter.com/m_ranjbar2/status/999709319380766720\">reported</a> that their registration and identifying photos were registered and time stamped with activity on Soroush, despite never having registered themselves.</p>\n<p>Other questionable services are Wispi and Bisphone.\u00a0Bisphone has not often been forthcoming regarding its connection to authorities. However, research has shown its <a href=\"https://medium.com/@kevinmiston/%DA%86%D8%B1%D8%A7-%D8%A8%DB%8C%D8%B3%D9%81%D9%88%D9%86-%DA%86%D8%B1%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%84%D9%87-%D9%88-%DA%86%D8%B1%D8%A7-%D8%AE%DB%8C%D8%B1-%D8%A8%D8%AE%D8%B4-%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%84-b862b5ee2765\">data is stored</a> with the Telecommunication Company of Iran, which is known to be partly owned by Iran's Revolutionary Guards.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The semi-official government news media, <a href=\"https://www.farsnews.com/news/13960116001340/%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%84-%D9%85%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AE%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D8%AA-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%B0%D8%A7%DA%A9%D8%B1%D9%87-%DB%8C%DA%A9-%D8%B4%D8%B1%DA%A9%D8%AA-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%AA%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D8%A7-%D9%BE%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%85%E2%80%8C%D8%B1%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%86-%DA%86%DB%8C%D9%86%DB%8C-%DA%A9%D8%B4%D9%81\">Fars News</a>, reported that the government has \u201cpossibly\u201d invested USD $21 million into the development of Wispi to moving the company's servers to Iran, despite the fact that Wispi belongs to the <a href=\"http://www.wispiapp.com/terms.html\">Hong Kong-based company</a> SG Atlantic Limited.</span></p>\n\n<p>Another approach sanctioned by government authorities has been that of Telegram Talaee and Hotgram, both of which are built on Telegram's technology. Although both services are owned by a private Iranian company Rahkar Sarzamin Hooshmand (Smart Land Strategy), there are indications of government involvement in their operation. Sources from the Ministry of Intelligence have confirmed that it is behind the platforms, while the Ministry of ICT has attempted to distance itself from the platforms.</p>\n<p>These unique options provide a sort of \u201cclient\u201d for Telegram, relying on the company's open API. A person using Hotgram, for example, is able to communicate with Telegram users and see most of the content that is available on Telegram channels. But Hotgram also functions as a filter. The company can choose to block users\u2019 access to certain content \u2014 and there is evidence that this is happening.</p>\n<p>US government-funded Radio Farda news service has an active channel on Telegram. But the channel is not accessible on\u00a0Telegram Talaee and Hotgram. This is consistent with Iranian government controls on Radio Farda, the website for which has been long blocked in Iran. We offer greater detail on this finding on <a href=\"https://www.article19.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/TTN-6_Eng_10.18.pdf\">page 14 of our report</a>.</p>\n<p>Generally, national platforms have no rigid privacy protocols to protect users, leaving Iranians at the mercy of government-run data collection and protection efforts. The dangers of these applications\u2019 data collection processes can be very real. There is precedent for Iranian authorities to use citizens\u2019 communications data to oppress or persecute users. Examples range from collecting information on whether users have illegal applications on their phones (as seen through the <a href=\"https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2017/11/irans-snapp-taxi-app-violates-user-privacy-rights-by-spying-on-users-phone-data/\">application Snapp)</a> to when intelligence authorities used mobile phone tracking technology to locate and arrest Isa Saharkhiz, a <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/Jailed_Iranian_Journalist_Takes_Nokia_to_Court/2130447.html\">journalist covering</a> the post-election protests of 2009.</p>\n<p>These dangers raise the question of how Telegram \u2014 a private company incorporated in the UK \u2014 manages the use and potential misuse of its technology by outside companies like Telegram Talaee and Hotgram. As long as Telegram leaves its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface\">API open</a>, companies like these will be able to build outside clients that connect to Telegram's API, but filter and potentially surveil users\u2019 activities.</p>\n<p>Telegram founder and CEO Pavel Durov has indicated before that there is \u201cno way to guarantee these third party apps are secure,\u201d yet Telegram has promoted the development of such clients, especially in Russia and Iran, where their primary platform is blocked. While the company cannot technically prevent the development of such clients without closing its API altogether, it could use policy and rhetoric to encourage client developers to abide by international human rights standards. This has yet to happen.</p>\n<p>In sum, while recent changes are not cutting Iranians off from the internet altogether, they are creating new kinds of threats to freedom of expression and privacy. Under contemporary censorship theory, which tries to reconcile existing patterns within authoritarian, or \u201ccontrolled\u201d communications systems, Iran is maintaining a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23831800-400-censored-why-chinas-online-oversight-is-anything-but-crude/\">porous censorship</a>\u201d model, with a twist of inventiveness. With the development of platforms such as Wispi and an increase in users on Telegram client applications, it seems this \u201cporous\u201d approach is presenting new threats to freedoms online in Iran.</p>\n</div>", "comments": [{"id": "5637", "news_id": 280, "fallacy": "none", "comment": "Luckily, there are no logical fallacies in other users' comments here and nothing to challenge or argue with because there are no other comments yet.

In one recent incident on June 10, Josu\u00e9 Garay, a journalist for La Prensa Nicaragua, was assaulted and robbed by people whom he believes are <a href=\"https://www.laprensa.com.ni/2018/06/10/nacionales/2433416-amenazan-y-golpean-al-periodista-de-la-prensa-josue-garay\">local members of the Sandinista Youth</a>.

The next iteration of the census <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Ukrainian_Census\">has been postponed</a> several times: originally planned for 2010, it was postponed until 2011, 2013, 2016, 2020 and finally, until 2023, with officials <a href=\"https://hromadske.ua/posts/u-2021-roci-najimovirnishe-ne-bude-vseukrayinskogo-perepisu-naselennya-ministr\">citing</a> high costs and organisational challenges.</p>\n<p>In the years following the momentous <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/specialcoverage/2013-special-coverage/ukraines-euromaiden-protests/\">Euromaidan protests</a> and turbulent political and social transformations, Ukraine has made strides in reforming state services for citizens and digitising a number of state systems, including <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prozorro\">state procurement</a> and <a href=\"https://tax.gov.ua/en/mass-media/news/print-414199.html\">tax reporting</a>.</p>\n<p>In 2020, the Ministry of Digital Transformation launched the revolutionary <a href=\"https://www.epravda.com.ua/publications/2020/02/7/656775/\">mobile application Diia</a> (Ukrainian for \u201caction\u201d), a cornerstone of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s campaign promise of making public services convenient and easily accessible via the internet. Today, the app is used by over 6 million Ukrainians and provides over 50 state services in digital format, including access to digital versions of vaccination certificates, passports, driver's licenses and other citizen documents and data.</p>\n<p>Though Diia has been hailed as a massive success, it has also faced criticism for its lax data security policies and lack of transparency around safeguards for citizens\u2019 digital identities. In May 2020, activists\u00a0<a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2020/10/21/who-is-selling-ukrainians-personal-data-online-and-why/\">discovered</a> about 900 GB of citizens\u2019 personal data, including passport numbers and driver's licenses, being traded by an anonymous chatbot on the popular messaging platform Telegram. While journalists and researchers were able to confirm that part of the datasets had come from Ukrainian government registries,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.ukrinform.ru/rubric-society/3056707-personalnye-dannye-na-prodazu-kto-vinovat-i-budet-li-nakazan.html\">no evidence</a> implicating Diia directly has been found.</p>\n<p>Still, few disclosures were made about the security of citizens\u2019 personal data on the app, and security specialists cautiously\u00a0<a href=\"https://nv.ua/ukr/techno/technoblogs/dodatok-diya-shcho-potribno-znati-pro-cifrovu-bezpeku-50069060.html\">noted</a> that not enough was known about Diia's security testing or any independent audits. The app's first <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuVduoxPJac\">public bug bounty program</a> was not launched until December 2020. Despite this, the government continues to <a href=\"https://dslua.org/publications/naskilky-tsyfrova-derzhava-vidpovidaie-mizhnarodnym-standartam-ta-pryntsypam-analiz-ta-obhovorennia/\">experiment</a> with citizen data, granting various Ministries the power to aggregate and cross-verify data from multiple state registries while <a href=\"https://zaborona.com/nebezbeka-derzhavy-u-smartfoni/\">lacking</a>\u00a0comprehensive legal safeguards ensuring citizens\u2019 right to privacy.</p>\n<h3>Apple's privacy struggles</h3>\n<p>Although the news of cooperation with Apple is a massive boon for Ukraine, the tech giant has struggled to cement its image as a privacy-loving company and an advocate for end-to-end encryption. Most recently, it endured controversy around plans to introduce <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/06/apples-privacy-reputation-is-at-risk-with-new-changes.html\">a system that would scan image hashes (unique numbers attached to encrypted images)</a> uploaded to its iCloud storage for content featuring child exploitation and reporting those to the US authorities.</p>\n<p>Privacy advocates <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/06/apples-privacy-reputation-is-at-risk-with-new-changes.html\">criticised</a> the system, suggesting Apple could be pressured by foreign governments to, for instance, repurpose the system to quash political speech. Online freedom group Electronic Frontier Foundation Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life\">called</a> the move a \u201cbackdoor\u201d providing governments with a way to access encrypted data.</p>\n<p>Using a popular tech solution such as an iOS-based app in a census comes with its own challenges. In an <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/features/census-2020-deadline-online-armed-with-the-apple-iphone-8-canvassers-enumerators-are-going-modern/\">April 2020 CNET report</a> on the US census which Apple supported with helping to develop the app for canvassers using iPhone 8, Stephen Moore, chief security strategist at Exabeam, a California-based cybersecurity company, <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/features/census-2020-deadline-online-armed-with-the-apple-iphone-8-canvassers-enumerators-are-going-modern/\">said</a> that unsanctioned access to census data was one \u201cmovie plot scenario\u201d that could compromise census security and shift perceptions among citizens:</p>\n<blockquote><p>That'll erode the competence of the system and it'll decrease participation, which may be the goal of some foreign adversary, and that's a risk.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In the US case, these dangers were mitigated by developers through \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/features/census-2020-deadline-online-armed-with-the-apple-iphone-8-canvassers-enumerators-are-going-modern/\">multifactor authentication, the use of security tokens and end-to-end encryption</a>\u201c, as well as limiting the iPhone functionality so canvassers could not browse the internet or download other apps. Even so, a February 2020 <a href=\"https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/GAO-20-368R%202-11-20.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">report from the Government Accountability Office</a> recommended that the US census bureau conduct more testing and assessments \u201cto improve system performance and scalability\u201d.</p>\n<p>It is as yet unclear which of these solutions will be implemented in Ukraine's census scenario and how the census-specific software and hardware will interact with the existing Diia framework to ensure citizen's data remain secure.</p>\n</div>", "comments": [{"id": "7497", "news_id": 500, "fallacy": "appeal to nature", "comment": "Apple is a tech company getting heavily involved with a country the is basically war torn.

Razak is currently facing up to 125 years in jail for corruption, and repealing the law was an election priority of new prime minister Mahathir Mohamad. The law provided for fines of up to USD $122,000 and jail time of up to six years for posting content the government deemed to be \u201cfake news\u201d. Though several countries have passed similar legislation, Malaysia is the first country to repeal such a law.</p>\n<h3><b>EU Commissioner mulls a 60-minute time limit for terrorist content removal</b></h3>\n<p>The EU Commissioner for Security, Julian King, is <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/eu-could-fine-tech-firms-if-they-fail-to-remove-terror-content-2018-8\">considering a regulation</a> that would force tech companies to remove terrorist content within 60 minutes of receiving a complaint from law enforcement. Companies would face steep fines if they failed to comply. The measure would raise of a host of difficult questions about the independence of these two entities. If approved, this would all but require tech companies to work side-by-side with EU law enforcement agencies, not unlike the relationship that <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2016/11/15/chinese-state-media-ceo-challenges-tencents-power-over-online-news/\">Chinese tech companies</a> maintain with their government.

Through their online platforms, users can raise awareness about issues otherwise ignored by the mainstream media and even provide valuable corroboration of war crimes, enabling <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2020/09/10/video-unavailable/social-media-platforms-remove-evidence-war-crimes\">perpetrators to be brought to justice</a>.</p>\n<p>In recent months, however, users raising awareness of human rights abuses on Instagram and Facebook (both owned by Meta) have found themselves at the mercy of Meta\u2019s algorithms and opaque content guidelines. As a result, Meta\u2019s \u201cOversight Board,\u201d (an appeal mechanism established by Meta for users who felt their content had been wrongly removed) has found itself not only reversing Meta\u2019s original decisions but also issuing policy guidance to enable the tech giant to better protect the rights of users.</p>\n<p>For instance, the board recently reversed Meta\u2019s decision to remove an Instagram video showing the bloody aftermath of a terrorist attack in\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.oversightboard.com/decision/IG-OZNR5J1Z/\">Nigeria</a>. The post had been taken down under Meta\u2019s policy prohibiting videos of intense, graphic violence and content containing sadistic remarks towards imagery depicting human suffering. It was removed even though none of the captions or hashtags accompanying the video had, according to a majority of the board, been intended to convey enjoyment or derive pleasure from the suffering of others. Rather, the posters were trying to spread awareness amongst their community. The fact that Nigeria had sought to suppress coverage of a recent spate of terror attacks was also vital to the board\u2019s decision to uphold the user\u2019s freedom of speech. Importantly, the board noted that Meta\u2019s understanding of the term \u201csadistic\u201d had not been made publicly available and that the internal guidance provided to the tech giant\u2019s moderators had been overly broad.</p>\n<p>In theory, the \u201c<a href=\"https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/policies/community-standards/violent-graphic-content/\">violent and graphic content policy</a>\u201d allows users to condemn and raise awareness about \u201cimportant issues such as human rights abuses, armed conflicts or acts of terrorism.\u201d However, the board noted that: \u201cthe Violent and Graphic Content policy does not make clear how Meta permits users to share graphic content to raise awareness of or document abuses.\u201d</p>\n<p>This was by no means the first time the board had raised such concerns. Before this decision, Meta removed a video <a href=\"https://oversightboard.com/decision/FB-AP0NSBVC/\">documenting the Sudan military\u2019s abusive response</a> to protestors following the army-led takeover of the civilian government. The company then reversed its decision under a \u201cnewsworthiness,\u201d exception, which allows content to remain visible when it is in the public interest. Though the board approved Meta\u2019s u-turn, it raised concerns that the newsworthiness policy did not make clear when content documenting atrocities would benefit from the allowance: the lack of definition clarifying the term \u201cnewsworthy\u201d left users at risk of \u201carbitrary\u201d and \u201cinconsistent,\u201d decisions. Furthermore, in the 12 months before March 2022, Meta had only issued 17 \u201cnewsworthiness\u201d exemptions under its violent content policy. Given that Meta had removed 90.7 million pieces of content under this community standard in the first three quarters of 2021, there were clear concerns that content that could be in the public interest was not getting through.</p>\n<p>Another target of the board\u2019s criticism has been Meta\u2019s policy prohibiting praise of <a href=\"https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/policies/community-standards/dangerous-individuals-organizations/\">dangerous individuals and organizations</a>. On various occasions, the board has\u00a0<a href=\"https://oversightboard.com/decision/FB-P93JPX02/\">recommended</a> that Meta elaborate criteria and illustrative examples to increase users\u2019 understanding of the exceptions for neutral discussion, condemnation, and news reporting. The board has stated that even the term \u201cpraise\u201d was not properly defined. Meta\u2019s internal guidance instructs reviewers to remove content for praise if it \u201cmakes people think more positively about\u201d a designated group \u201c<a href=\"https://oversightboard.com/decision/FB-U2HHA647/\">making the meaning of \u2018praise\u2019 less about the intent of the speaker but the effects on the audience</a>.\u201d Hence, users clearly\u00a0<a href=\"https://oversightboard.com/decision/IG-I9DP23IB/\">criticizing human rights abuses</a>\u00a0or even reporting neutrally on the activities of the\u00a0<a href=\"https://oversightboard.com/decision/FB-U2HHA647/\">Taliban</a> have had their posts removed if they happened to mention an organization targeted by the policy.\u00a0 This is exacerbated by the fact that Meta has left its list of dangerous organizations hidden from the public.</p>\n<p>These concerns are nothing new. In an extensive\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.article19.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Regulating-speech-by-contract-WEB-v2.pdf\">analysis</a>, the NGO Article 19 noted as far back as 2018 that the terms of service of the dominant social media giants \u2014 YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Google \u2014 were characterized by a lack of transparency and lower standards when it came to free speech.</p>\n<p>To reinforce its content moderation teams, Meta has established a system of \u201cMedia Matching Service banks,\u201d which automatically identify and remove images that have been previously identified by human reviewers as violating the company's rules. Initially designed to enable Meta to make decisions at speed and at scale, such systems have ended up amplifying the impact of erroneous human decisions.</p>\n<p>On one occasion, a user who posted a cartoon\u00a0<a href=\"https://oversightboard.com/decision/FB-I964KKM6/\">criticizing the Colombian</a> police had their comment removed after it automatically matched with an image previously flagged as problematic by a human reviewer. In the board\u2019s view, given the cartoon's clear aim of criticizing state actors or actions, Facebook had been wrong to add it to the bank in the first place. Further exacerbating its concerns, was the fact that hundreds of other users had also posted the same cartoon and had their posts removed by Meta\u2019s automated systems. Two hundred and fifteen of these users appealed these removals, 98 percent of whom were successful. Despite this, Meta was slow to remove the cartoon from the media bank.</p>\n<p>Conversely, in a decision regarding <a href=\"https://www.oversightboard.com/decision/FB-E1154YLY/\">Ethiopia</a>, the board criticized Meta for being too slow to take action against content fuelling ethnic tension and armed conflicts. According to the board: \u201cmore transparency is needed to assess whether Meta's measures are consistently proportionate throughout a conflict and across all armed conflict contexts.\u201d While Meta appeared to take prompt action during the Russia\u2013Ukraine conflict, it has been too slow with other conflict-afflicted regions such as Ethiopia and Myanmar. The Ethiopian decision laid bare some of the difficulties in policing speech in the context of an ongoing armed conflict. According to a public comment submitted by an academic, there was a \u201clack of engagement with communities in Ethiopia.\u201d Content inciting violence against Tigrayans had \u201cslipped through the cracks,\u201d due to a lack of moderators that spoke the native language. In one instance, a Facebook post calling for cleansing Tigrayans from the Amhara region remained on the platform for more than four months. Citing a <a href=\"https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2022-02-20/facebook-accused-of-letting-activists-incite-ethnic-massacres-with-hate-and-misinformation-by-survivors-in-ethiopia\">report</a> by the Bureau of Investigative Journalists, the commenter noted that online hate campaigns had fuelled abuses against Tigrayans living in the city of Gondar.</p>\n<p>Given the sheer volume of content that Meta regulates on its platforms \u2014 23.2 million posts deemed violent and graphic were \u201c<a href=\"https://transparency.fb.com/data/community-standards-enforcement/graphic-violence/facebook/\">actioned,</a>\u201d in the third quarter of 2022 \u2014 it is inevitable that the company will continue to tread the fine line between protecting users\u2019 freedom of speech and ensuring that Facebook and Instagram do not become safe havens for illegal content. The <a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act-ensuring-safe-and-accountable-online-environment_en\">drive globally</a> to push online content providers to take a firmer stance against misinformation and hate speech will only exacerbate the risks inherent in this process. Though the board\u2019s policy recommendations provide much-needed guidance on how to get the balance right, there is a catch: as the name suggests, the recommendations are advisory only. Meta is not obliged to implement them (though it has committed to respond to them within <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Bylaws_v6.pdf\">60 days</a>). If Meta is to continue to be a safe space for human rights defenders, it will have to engage seriously and in good faith with the Oversight Board.</p>\n</div>", "comments": [{"id": "4754", "news_id": 186, "fallacy": "appeal to worse problems", "comment": "People need to stop appealing and clogging up the boards work for things that are trivial.

Ethnologue reports the size and vitality of Kadazan as \u2018Endangered\u2019 with that red color, which means it is no longer the norm for children to learn and use this language.</p>\n<p>It is present online in one form or another. There are several Facebook groups that use a \u2018Let\u2019s Learn\u2019 concept, where the members support each other by conversing in the language. Most recently, there has been active input online from the local Sabah Cultural Board on their social media platform. That is a positive development, especially when they involve the ethnic bodies or associations and the youths. There used to be an online version of a local newspaper that has indigenous language news columns, but sadly no more. The indigenous language page on another local daily also finally stopped last year.</p>\n<p>Material-wise, in my opinion, Kadazan is quite [far] ahead compared to the other indigenous languages, in that it already has several printed dictionaries. There is also a dedicated radio channel in the language.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>RV: What do you think are the biggest challenges facing your language community when it comes to digital communications or creating digital content in their mother language?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>JS:</strong> In my opinion, the biggest challenge would be perhaps in getting sustained interest [from the audience] to view digital content in indigenous languages, and for digital content creators to be motivated to continue creating digital content in the indigenous language.</p>\n<p>Digital content creators are many, but a glance on YouTube shows sporadic uploads. I believe this is also because digital content needs audience for feedback and to motivate the content creators. Is there interest from the indigenous communities to hear or see their indigenous languages online? This is perhaps a question that the indigenous communities need to ask themselves because language champions cannot work in a vacuum, we need the indigenous communities too to be interested to champion their languages, to want to sustain their languages, and together, the collaboration will then be more successful, offline or online.</p>\n<p>That is [when] we are talking about local indigenous viewers. On another hand, digital content need not be limited to just local viewers/audience from your neighborhood. The netizens of the world are [a] potential audience. If you make your content interesting and you have subtitles in English (or whatever language you aim to have viewers from), netizens from all over the world will be able to engage with your material.</p>\n<p>Having said [this], digital content creators need good internet access, and especially in the rural areas where families are still using the indigenous language in their home as their first language (L1). So these challenges can be in the form of sustained interest, translation capacities, as well as internet access.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>RV: In your opinion, what are some of the steps that could be taken to encourage increased use of the language on the internet?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>JS:</strong> 1) Better internet access in all areas. 2) Training for content creators from the rural areas \u2013 perhaps provide them with internet data credit (and digital equipment, if they don\u2019t have any e.g. smart phones). 3) Training for content creators to include translation of their contents into the national language or English. This is what digital content creators in Indonesia (the nearest example) do when they have content in their dialects. They include subtitles in Bahasa Indonesia. The topic could be any topic under the sun, but viewers need not be limited to just those who [can] speak [the language]. Perhaps collaboration can be made between digital content creators (those who are tech savvy) and those in their network who are fluent speakers to provide the translations. 4) Ethnic associations could pool their resources together to produce online newspapers in their indigenous languages.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>RV: What is your primary motivation for working to see your language and culture available on the internet?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>JS: </strong>My primary motivation is to know that my identity as an indigenous person remains relevant even as time moves on. In the future, I hope to see the indigenous languages and culture move away from the labels of \u2018threatened\u2019 or \u2018endangered\u2019. Some may ask why, it is inevitable, they are not part of this modern era and we need to move on to catch up with the rest of the world. Precisely so, by using technology we can bring the indigenous languages to catch up to the times. The indigenous languages don\u2019t have to stay in dusty cabinets. We can use technology to have our languages and cultures available online \u2013 for our young and old generations and for others to learn it as well. It has been done before by other communities, albeit with hard work and commitment.</p></blockquote>\n</div>", "comments": [{"id": "7586", "news_id": 530, "fallacy": "appeal to worse problems", "comment": "While I get why people want to preserve their languages, I feel like this isn't that big a deal, especially in developing countries like this.

Most of them are active on Facebook, where they post about their life and news about Myanmar,\u201d Crox told me via email. During the pandemic, he started learning Burmese, which led him to pay extra attention to stories coming out of Myanmar.</p>\n<p>And when a military coup took place in Myanmar on February 1, he began\u00a0posting \u2014 on social media and various online platforms \u2014 news and information about the ensuing protests.</p>\n<p>I interviewed Crox about his efforts in enhancing communication between the two countries and his observations on the political situation in Myanmar. His responses have been edited for brevity and clarity.</p>\n<p><strong>Oiwan Lam (OL): Why do you feel the urge to bring news and information about the ongoing protests in Myanmar to Hong Kong netizens?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Ben Crox (BC)</strong>: Myanmar is not very connected to the world. Even though Hong Kong is a major trade partner with Myanmar, most of my peers in Hong Kong never talk about Myanmar. But in recent years, the country has been a new tourist site for young Hongkongers. For a few, they may also travel to Myanmar for religious retreat or for causes related to humanitarian aid.</p>\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has hit Myanmar hard and I have been donating to help some of my Myanmar friends. But when the military suddenly takes over, the money wiring channels are blocked. The only thing I can do is to help Myanmar people spread their voice and news.</p>\n<p>I believe what has happened in Myanmar would echo in the minds of many Hongkongers, because our rights, our freedom, our hope for the future are also being deprived by similar institutionalized state violence.</p>\n<p>The protest scenes in Myanmar look similar to Hong Kong. Many of my Burmese friends are eager to learn from Hong Kong\u2019s protest experience and they have been trying to link with the Milk Tea Alliance, an online network of pro-democracy netizens coming from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand and India.</p>\n<p>People from many Asian countries share the dream of establishing a clean and democratic government, with which fair opportunities and variety will be ensured. And I share this dream as well.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>OL: The internet in Myanmar has been disrupted since the military coup. How do you get the latest updates? How do you make sure that the information is reliable?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>BC:</strong> The internet in Myanmar has been disrupted, but it has not been completely cut off. The Junta want to keep the foreign factories and facilities running. At the same time, a lot of small businesses also heavily rely on the internet. In the first phase of disruption, only the mobile network was affected, while wifi and some fibre networks were still functioning. We later learnt that the mobile internet has been filtered with some old version of Chinese-style Great Firewall. But that has not stopped people from connecting through VPNs. Recently, the military is trying to set a new norm with a complete shutdown of the internet after midnight from 1 a.m. to 9 a.m. But internet access during office hours has not been compromised yet.</p>\n<p>So I can still receive a lot of instant updates from multiple sources. Most are shared on Facebook groups, personal feeds of my connections. Many English-speaking Myanmar netizens, especially those with journalistic background, also use Twitter as a civilian reporting channel.</p>\n<p>Myanmar people are well aware of the Junta tactic of spreading disinformation. Quite frequently, they would warn each other against the so-called \u201cpsy-war\u201d \u2014 the term refers to the psychological effects of disinformation. Most people are willing to take down the news if others have expressed doubts. I have also edited or taken down information on my social media timeline upon getting messages from my Burmese friends. If possible I would share videos that could be verified with other videos taken with different angles on the same spot from different sources. Usually, such verification process only takes a few minutes since many protesters recorded or live-streamed the protest scenes with their smartphones.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>OL: In the past few days, reportedly the Myanmar military government has open fired and killed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/06/myanmar-stop-military-killing-protesters-envoy-tells-security-council\">more than 50 protesters</a>. How do you feel about the situation? Do you think the protests will still go on? </strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>BC:</strong> Bloodshed happens every day. Some stringent sources have estimated over 50 martyrs, while hearsay said the figure was double. Videos and photos circulating online have proven that the military crackdown was extremely bloody and brutal. However, such a bloody crackdown is not new in the history of Myanmar and people are not backing off.</p>\n<p>I still remember in January 2017, one day right after I landed in Yangon, Ko Ni, a prominent Muslim lawyer and an advocate of constitutional reform, was fatally shot outside the airport. A few of my friends were close to Ko Ni and were hit by the loss of a dear friend and a great leader. But they live with the pain and take it as drive for their continuous fight for a better future. They were not ruined in 2017 and now their ire is turning into fire.</p>\n<p>In addition, Myanmar Generation Z is fearless and they have full support from the older generation. The junta cannot stop them and now the younger generation is joining them. The solidarity among protesters is invincible.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>OL: You have participated in several rounds of discussion on Myanmar protests on social media platforms such as Clubhouse. What has been accomplished through this cross-border dialogue?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>BC:</strong> During the discussion I tried to help people from outside of Myanmar to better understand the country\u2019s situation. I shared with them what I had learnt from my friends and my working experience in Myanmar and tried to explain the historical and political context of the protests. I also explained the relationship between the protests in Hong Kong, Thailand and Myanmar, in particular on how Myanmar protesters were eager to be connected with the Milk Tea Alliance and other pro-democracy movements in Asia.</p>\n<p>I believe that Hongkongers can help Myanmar\u2019s protesters and bring more international media attention to the situation in Myanmar. While a huge amount of visual images about the military coup and people\u2019s protests have been circulating on Twitter and Facebook, the stories behind the images need to be told and explained. Hongkongers can play a good role in distributing and bridging the information.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>OL: You have been paying close attention to protests in Hong Kong, Thailand, and Myanmar. How do you compare the pro-democracy movement in the three countries? Do you observe any interactions among protesters or pro-democracy activists across the three regions? Will such interactions bring positive changes in Asia?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>BC:</strong> Protests in Hong Kong, in Thailand and in Myanmar are quite different as the three regions have different political systems, but protesters from the three regions share common goals. Exchanges among activists could help reflect on the inadequacy of local protests and develop a wider horizon in understanding the significance of the pro-democracy movement in Asia.</p>\n<p>For example, the divide between pro-independence and moderate democrats in the Hong Kong protest movement has destroyed the internal communication of strategies and tactics within the movement to the extent that no one could bargain or negotiate with the government. The pro-democracy sector in Myanmar used to have a lot of racial conflicts. But now more than 90 percent of people are united against the coup, that's their advantage.</p>\n<p>I believe that protesters in Asia can learn, inspire and support each other in future struggles for democracy. The democracy movement against authoritarian regimes in Asia is up and evolving, a new generation of activists has shown their determination and capability. The future is on their side.</p></blockquote>\n</div>", "comments": [{"id": "6130", "news_id": 444, "fallacy": "none", "comment": "This is a nice example of how 1 person can make a difference.

Later that afternoon, a minority of the protesters attempted to charge the Legco building.</p>\n<p>In response, riot police indiscriminately deployed tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the protesters, including against those situated in peaceful sit-in areas.</p>\n<p>On the same day, Stephen Lo, the city's then-police commissioner, defined the June 12 protests as a \u201criot\u201d, implying that those who participated could be subjected to a charge carrying a maximum term of 10 years in jail.</p>\n<p>Chief Executive Carrie Lam stood by the commissioner's judgment and the riot label. However, a majority of Hong Kong citizens disagreed with the definition.</p>\n<p>Four days later, on June 16, <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2019/06/17/step-down-carrie-lam-two-million-rise-up-once-more-against-the-hong-kong-extradition-bill/\">two million Hongkongers</a> took to the street chanting slogans that included \u201cstudents are not rioters,\u201d \u201cwe are not rioting\u201d. The five major demands of the anti-extradition movement also included \u201cthe withdrawal of the riot label.\u201d</p>\n<p>However, the government has not responded to the demands and protesters continue striking. The number of arrested protesters continues to rise.</p>\n<p>The Stand News submitted an inquiry about the number of arrests to the police authority.</p>\n<p>Between June 9, 2019, and May 31, 2020, Hong Kong police arrested 8,986 individuals during protests. So far, the department of justice has pressed charges against 1,808 protesters and the most frequent charge is \u201crioting\u201d.</p>\n<p>In one court case heard at a district court on May 4, a 21-year-old lifeguard who participated in the June 12 protest pleaded guilty to a charge of rioting.</p>\n<p>The magistrate stressed that the anti-extradition protesters \u201cdirectly undermined the rule of law\u201d and \u201cdisregard law and the safety of police officers.\u201d As a result, the sentence has to take account of public interest and act as a deterrent to future crimes, the magistrate said.</p>\n<p>The starting point for riot charge sentencing is six-year-imprisonment. However, as the defendant pleaded guilty, the sentence was reduced to four years in jail.</p>\n<p>The 612 individuals presently facing rioting charges will have to go through similar judicial processes.</p>\n<p>Once they are found guilty, they will have to spend a few years of their youth in jail, their plans for the future put on hold.</p>\n<p>Below is an infographic of the age profile of 598 \u201crioters\u201d who have their cases registered at courts (14 of the 612 cases have not reached court yet).</p>\n\n<p>The average age of defendants is 23. The oldest is 61 and the youngest just 13. Fourteen of the \u201crioters\u201d are under 16 years old.

The following article, which addresses concerns and implications of China's attempts to normalize its military action, was written by Brain Hioe and first published in New Bloom <a href=\"https://newbloommag.net/2022/08/08/china-military-drill-continue/\">on August 8, 2022</a>. It is republished on Global Voices under a content partnership agreement with New Bloom.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">After six full days of military exercises on the coast of Taiwan, it remains unclear whether China will cease its drilling or continue in the coming days. China's People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) initially announced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/03/china-to-begin-series-unprecedented-live-fire-drills-off-coast-of-taiwan\"><span class=\"s1\">its four days of live-fire drills</span></a> would end on August 7, <a href=\"https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/politics/breakingnews/4017372\"><span class=\"s1\">but then it announced that military exercises in the area would continue.</span></a> The drills are an escalation for the Chinese military, seeing as they take place closer to Taiwan than in previous conflicts, like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Taiwan_Strait_Crisis\">Third Taiwan Straits Crisis</a> from 1995\u20131996.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> The drills on August 8 <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/chinese-military-drills-continue-around-taiwan-monday-2022-08-08/\">emphasised on anti-submarine warfare and sea raids.</a>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The announcement did not specify when or where any upcoming drills would take place but said that they should end by August 10. National militaries typically announce 24 hours in advance when planning live-fire exercises. That being said, China changed its original specifications for drilling, adding a new location to its original plan. In response, Taiwan\u2019s Maritime and Port Bureau recommended that Taiwanese fishing and commercial vessels avoid these areas <a href=\"https://www.ettoday.net/news/20220804/2309100.htm\"><span class=\"s1\">on Thursday morning.</span></a></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Stories from PRC media claim that PLAN destroyer Nanjing was found 11.78 km away from Hoping Power Plant in Hualien. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ROCNavy?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ROCNavy</a> denounces such disinformation.

Though it is unclear whether the drills are, in fact, over, <a href=\"https://t.co/DKy8gyG09x\"><span class=\"s1\">maritime traffic through affected areas has resumed.</span></a> During the drilling, the Taiwanese government warned fishing vessels not to pass through the area, to maintain communication with the proper authorities, and to notify authorities if they encountered any Chinese vessels.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Nevertheless, the Chinese government has stepped up its efforts to militarily intimidate other powers in the region, not just Taiwan. During the course of the four-day drilling, China lobbed missiles over Taiwan, the first time that China has done so, with missiles fired from Pingtan passing over Taipei and into the drilling area to simulate an assault on Taipei.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Yet some missiles also landed in Japan\u2019s exclusive economic zone,\u00a0<a href=\"https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/world/breakingnews/4015789\"><span class=\"s1\">which Japan\u2019s Ministry of Defense believes was deliberate.</span></a>\u00a0Chinese vessels were also reported to have\u00a0<a href=\"https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/world/breakingnews/4017597\"><span class=\"s1\">approached the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyutai Islands</span></a>\u00a0before being warned off, something which also took place before the Pelosi visit.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">China\u2019s efforts at intimidation have not only targeted Japan, however, with plans to conduct drilling in the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea, near South Korea. It is unclear why China has decided to preemptively lash out with a show of force against regional powers with close military ties to the US when this might encourage more cooperation between other powers in the region and foster closer ties with the West. Indeed, a meeting between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the president of the Philippines, \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos, <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1642013/blinken-bongbong-marcos-reaffirm-defense-treaty-president-says-its-in-constant-evolution\"><span class=\"s1\">served to reaffirm US-Philippines military ties</span></a> amid this crisis.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Taiwan intends to carry out\u00a0<a href=\"https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202208080012\"><span class=\"s1\">military drills this week in Pingtung,</span></a>\u00a0in light of recent events. However, this will take place inland, so as to avoid inflaming regional tensions. If China intends to carry out a blockade of Taiwan, it is unlikely that the Taiwanese military would not react to it in some way. Today, the Ministry of National Defense reported on Chinese information warfare, stating that it had found 272 disinformation messages this month.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">A pleasure to meet Philippine President <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bongbongmarcos?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@bongbongmarcos</a> to discuss ways to strengthen our longstanding alliance with the Philippines.

The US has announced that it will soon sail vessels through the Taiwan Strait, which the Chinese government has begun making claims over, and retains forces on standby in the region. The US and India will also conduct joint military exercises near the disputed border with China in the coming days.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">At the same time, despite clearly heightened tensions, it bears reminding we are still far from anything resembling a full-scale invasion of Taiwan, which would be telegraphed in advance through soldiers massing on the coasts of China and is complicated by China\u2019s lack of sufficient ships to bring troops over to conduct a long-term occupation of Taiwan. Nor is it as though the US and China are on the verge of nuclear war over Taiwan; if Ukraine is to serve as any example, the US would be highly cautious of direct involvement in a conflict, in spite of the high-level ties that the US and Taiwan currently enjoy. Though the risk of escalation is certainly there, it is also important to avoid unrealistic, hyperbolic views of the present outlook as well.</p>\n</div>", "comments": [{"id": "5927", "news_id": 377, "fallacy": "none", "comment": "Everyone needs to pay attention to this.

They live-streamed the event on Facebook.</p>\n\n<p>Chinese non-profit media the Stand News reported on the panel discussion in which Sampson Wong <a href=\"https://thestandnews.com/art/%E4%BA%BA%E4%BA%BA%E9%83%BD%E5%8F%AF%E6%88%90-pussy-riot-%E7%84%A1%E6%87%BC%E5%B7%B4%E4%B8%9F%E8%8D%89%E5%B1%95%E5%8F%AB%E5%81%9C-%E9%96%8B%E5%B9%95%E8%AC%9B%E5%BA%A7%E7%A7%BB%E5%B8%AB%E6%B7%B1%E6%B0%B4%E5%9F%97/\">expressed concerns</a> about Badiucao\u2019s safety. He explained that he has been trying to contact the artist since November 2, but that Badiucao has been incommunicado. Wong saw the exhibition as a test case for freedom of expression in Hong Kong. He was disappointed that more people had not spoken out against the threats from Beijing.</p>\n<p>Oscar Ho, a local art critic and scholar, was shocked by the cancellation. He pointed out that Beijing\u2019s censorship practices in Hong Kong are unclear. There is a general expectation that Hong Kongers \u201cshould know\u201d where the red line lies, but there are relatively few clear indications of what is and is not permissible. He expressed a desire for people to be more creative in fighting against censorship.</p>\n<p>Joshua Wong said he wanted more exchange with international civil society, in hopes that international networks could help local groups defend democracy and freedom.</p>\n<p>Pussy Riot member Olga Kuracheva emphasized the importance of public support and solidarity for people like Badiucao:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We are very sorry to know that things are getting worse here. I think it is very important to be here now just to express our solidarity\u2026 I would advise people not to be afraid, because one voice is not so much\u2026but voices of solidarity should sound loud.

The only way to avoid transmission is to maintain public and personal hygiene and reduce social contact. The Hong Kong Education Bureau announced during the Lunar New Year that <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education/article/3048305/hong-kong-universities-suspend-classes-until-march-china\">all schools would remain closed until March.</a> Universities have shifted to virtual classroom arrangements and many public institutions and businesses are allowing employees to work from home.</p>\n<h3><strong>The specter of SARS</strong></h3>\n<p>Seventeen years ago, in February 2003, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_SARS_outbreak\">the first case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)</a> entered Hong Kong from Guangdong. By June 2003, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC539564/\">1,750 cases were identified and 286 individuals had died</a>. About 80 percent of the infections could be traced back to the first case.</p>\n<p>While the Wuhan coronavirus is not as deadly as SARS, the scale of the outbreak is 10 times bigger, and thanks to the cover-up by the Chinese authorities, mainland Chinese residents were not initially informed of the outbreak and did not, therefore, take protective measures in the early stages.</p>\n<p>In early January, we Hong Kong residents tried to alert mainland Chinese netizens of the outbreak, but the online patriots responded by parroting a common conspiracy theory\u2014that Hongkongers were trying to create panic in China so as to undermine the authorities.</p>\n<p>Hongkongers had started wearing masks before Lunar New Year, while Wuhan residents were still holding their grand year-end feasts and ceremonies, unprotected. When shops reopened after Lunar New Year, Hongkongers started stocking up on daily necessities in preparation for life under semi-quarantine, anticipating that the virus would not subside until summer.</p>\n<h3><strong>Empty shelves\n</strong></h3>\n<p>As we have a child whose school requires that students wear masks whenever their classmates have the flu, we always have a two-month stock of children's masks on hand. Coincidentally, my husband bought a few packs of masks during a recent conference trip to South Korea after Lunar New Year, so we didn't have to line up for hours to buy masks.</p>\n<p>As the coronavirus has spread to other Asian countries, a ban on the export of masks has led to a shortage. While the World Health Organization (WHO) has advised that it isn't necessary for people to wear masks unless they have developed flu symptoms, population density in Hong Kong makes it very difficult to maintain the recommended two-meter social distance between people, and in spaces such as apartment building lifts, social distance is reduced to nearly zero.</p>\n<p>Macau, a sister city adjacent to Hong Kong which is also subject to China's \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_country,_two_systems\">One Country, two systems</a>\u201d principle, has adopted a quota policy to ensure that all residents can buy 10 masks every 10 days for the equivalent of 1 US dollar. The Hong Kong government, however, has not only failed to ensure a supply of masks for civilians, but also of masks and other protective gear for medical workers in public hospitals. The Health Authority has only <a href=\"https://news.mingpao.com/ins/%E6%B8%AF%E8%81%9E/article/20200208/s00001/1581137507826/%E3%80%90%E6%AD%A6%E6%BC%A2%E8%82%BA%E7%82%8E%E3%80%91%E6%A5%8A%E8%AB%A6%E5%B2%A1-%E5%85%AC%E9%99%A2%E5%8F%A3%E7%BD%A9%E5%AD%98%E9%87%8F%E5%83%85%E5%A4%A0%E7%94%A81%E5%80%8B%E6%9C%88-%E9%9C%80%E8%AC%B9%E6%85%8E%E6%8E%A7%E5%88%B6%E5%AD%98%E5%80%89%E9%87%8F\">a one-month supply</a> in stock, and the government has to request approval for the export of gear from Beijing, against the backdrop of an even more serious shortage in China.</p>\n<p>Also in short supply on the Hong Kong market for the past two weeks are alcohol-based cleansers, bleach, rice and toilet paper. Last week I visited five supermarkets in my neighbourhood and could not find a single pack of rice. Eventually, my husband had to line up outside a supermarket early in the morning to get hold of a pack. In order to get a 500ml bottle of bleach for regular household disinfection, I have to contact my district councillor to get a free-token. Back in January, the majority of district councils approved a budget to buy masks and hygiene products to help tackle the epidemic at a grassroots level.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>#saveourselves\n</strong></h3>\n<p>The Hong Kong government keeps urging people not to panic, but of course, after the\u00a0<a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/specialcoverage/the-people-of-hong-kong-vs-the-china-extradition-bill/\">prolonged protests</a> triggered by the anti-extradition movement, few believe that the government has the will or ability to protect the city or to put people's legitimate interests before the political interests of Beijing. Their failure to secure the supply of masks and their indecision around restricting travel between mainland China and Hong Kong are obvious examples of this.</p>\n<p>In the eyes of the public, the Hong Kong government is determined only to save themselves, and the hashtag #saveourselves (\u6e2f\u4eba\u81ea\u6551\uff09has been widely used on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23%E6%B8%AF%E4%BA%BA%E8%87%AA%E6%95%91&amp;src=typed_query\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/search/posts/?q=%23%E6%B8%AF%E4%BA%BA%E8%87%AA%E6%95%91&amp;epa=SEARCH_BOX\">Facebook</a> and other social media platforms to criticize the government and to spread information on protective measures such as personal and household hygiene, including a simple chemical formula for home-made alcohol-based cleanser, how to make reusable masks, etc.</p>\n<p>In the spirit of #saveourselves, people are also sharing with others in need. For example, after I told friends on Facebook that my family was running out of rice, within 24 hours two acquaintances offered me some of their surplus stock. Organizations with overseas trading connections are helping to channel supplies of masks to grassroots workers, and volunteer groups have taken to social media platforms to urge people to donate their surplus face masks to the elderly.</p>\n<p>The determination of the anti-government protest has quickly morphed into a determination to fight against the spread of the coronavirus.</p>\n<h3><strong>Managing fear</strong></h3>\n<p>The shortage of daily necessities and the semi-quarantine have made life more difficult for everyone. For families with kids, the outbreak has tripled the daily workload. We now have to care for our 6-year-old round the clock, chase after daily necessities, manage household hygiene, and prepare three meals a day while fulfilling the duties of our regular jobs.</p>\n<p>To reduce the use of masks, we don\u2019t go out often. My husband and I take turns going out three times a day, to buy bread and check in on supermarkets and pharmacies in the morning, to take our daughter to the park for a few hours in the afternoon, and to go to the market to buy vegetables and fruit in the late afternoon. The park is half-empty as people are worried about the transmission of coronavirus among kids. I have received friendly warnings on parenting WhatsApp groups about taking kids to the park, but my husband and I have nevertheless decided to let our daughter enjoy a few hours of daily sunshine. We are determined not to let ourselves be overwhelmed by fear, even though the circumstances are rather scary.</p>\n<p>What worries me most, however, is the spread of fear and hatred in public discourse, as it can easily escalate into bigoted sentiment against the mainland Chinese. It is clear that the centre of the outbreak is the city of Wuhan and that a number of provinces in mainland China are on the verge of large-scale outbreaks. But while I agree that we should restrict travellers from mainland China entering Hong Kong, and understand when other countries impose similar restrictions on Hong Kong residents, I find labelling mainland Chinese as selfish game-meat consumers and dishonest virus-spreaders completely untenable, especially as it ignores the fact that the majority of travellers entering Hong Kong during the Lunar New Year are local residents returning from their annual family visits in mainland China.</p>\n<p>The spread of fear and hatred has also led to a number of extreme <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY\">not-in-my-backyard-</a>style protests. It is true that the government has not held public consultations about selecting sites for isolating people who have had direct contact with coronavirus patients, and local residents should have the right to voice out their concerns. <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3047719/wuhan-coronavirus-hong-kong-police-protesters\">Throwing petrol bombs </a>to destroy such facilities, however, cannot be justified.</p>\n<p>I hope that the fear and hatred directed against mainland Chinese will subside as more human interest stories emerge from Wuhan and Hubei province. Incidents such as <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2020/02/07/coronavirus-death-of-whistleblower-li-wenliang-sets-chinese-social-media-on-fire/\">the death of Dr. Li Wenliang</a> have reminded Hongkongers that the misery in Wuhan and other mainland Chinese cities is a result of the cover-up of the epidemic by the Chinese government in the name of political stability above all else. Like it or not, the fate of mainland Chinese people and Hongkongers are inextricably intertwined.</p>\n<p>I have started talking with my daughter about the outbreak, first by explaining why she has to wear a mask when playing in the park, letting her know that it is not just about protecting oneself but also others, especially the elderly and babies, whose immune systems are weaker and less able to resist disease. I also told her the story of Dr. Li Wenliang and how he was arrested for spreading rumours when what he had said was in fact true.</p>\n<p>Stick to the truth and be empathetic to others, I tell her. This is the way to #saveourselves.</p>\n<p><b>Check out Global Voices\u2019 special coverage of </b><a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/specialcoverage/how-will-the-wuhan-coronavirus-impact-the-political-future-of-china/\"><b>the impact of the Wuhan coronavirus</b></a><b>. </b></p>\n</div>", "comments": [{"id": "3016", "news_id": 6, "fallacy": "none", "comment": "My heart goes out to the Hong Kong residents trying to survive in a semi-quarantine atmosphere with shortages of much needed essentials.

After the Chinese Communist Party won the Civil War and established the People's Republic of China in 1949, a large number of <a href=\"https://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1867&amp;context=iwp_archive\">writers escaped to Hong Kong</a> and settled in the colony. They started the city's proud \u201cexile literature\u201d tradition, which is a distinctive part of Hong Kong's cultural identity.</p>\n<p>Novelist Louis Cha and film producer Raymond Chow \u2014 two Hong Kong cultural icons who died in the past two weeks \u2014 are two eminent examples: they have shined a light on the freedoms Hong Kong has enjoyed, in contrast with the mainland. <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-gripping-stories-and-political-allegories-of-chinas-best-selling-author\">Cha moved to Hong Kong in 1949</a> to escape communist attacks in China, and was able to flourish in the relative freedoms enjoyed here. Similarly, Chow moved to Hong Kong in the early 1950s and brought the likes of Bruce Lee to the world.</p>\n<p>With this backdrop, a cancellation of such an event points to shifting winds in Hong Kong's artistic climate.\u00a0Chinese-Australian cartoonist Badiucao, whose work explores abuses of power and whose real identity is kept secret,\u00a0<a href=\"https://advox.globalvoices.org/2018/11/06/political-cartoonist-badiucao-abruptly-cancelled-his-hong-kong-exhibition-and-then-went-silent/\">canceled his debut solo exhibition</a> in Hong Kong earlier in November after what he claims were \u201cthreats\u201d from China.</p>\n<p>\u201cI really admire artists and dissidents who are brave enough to do it openly. I see myself as a coward,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/11/04/badiucao-interview-i-think-witnessing-dying-hong-kong/\">told Hong Kong Free Press</a> a week before the exhibition's cancellation. He also expressed concerns about how the city is failing to protect its controversial artists: \u201cI think we are witnessing the dying of Hong Kong.\u201d</p>\n<p>These new \u2018rules\u2019 of Hong Kong art etiquette even extend to the commercial film and music industries as well.
