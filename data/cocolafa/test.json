For the first time, women television show hosts, radio presenters, and newscasters decided to turn off their microphones in the studio and take their voices to the streets.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"und\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LasPeriodistasParamos?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LasPeriodistasParamos</a><a href=\"https://t.co/IyIJBV00cO\">https://t.co/IyIJBV00cO</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Ana Pastor (@_anapastor_) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_anapastor_/status/971800911940063232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 8, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"translation\"><p>#WeWomenJournalistsStrike</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"es\">En la informaci\u00f3n parlamentaria trabajan muchas, muchas, muchas mujeres.

Overall, 75 percent of Spanish executives are men.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the wage gap continues to exist in the field. Eighty-five percent of Spanish journalists earning less than 1,000 euros (about 1,200 US dollars) are women.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"und\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HuelgaFeminista?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#HuelgaFeminista</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/8M?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#8M</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/lasperiodistasparamos?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#lasperiodistasparamos</a><a href=\"https://t.co/eWvis1R7DM\">pic.twitter.com/eWvis1R7DM</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Elsa Garc\u00eda de Blas (@ElsaGarciad) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElsaGarciad/status/971815979897491457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 8, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"translation\"><p>Tweet reads: #FeministStrike #8March #WeWomenJournalistsStrike</p>\n<p>Sign in image reads: We are the granddaughters of the women who weren't allowed to write.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Beyond economic demands, another key point in the manifesto was workplace harassment, following the wave of protests like #MeToo and #TimeIsUp. Women journalists run an extra risk: In addition to harassment by superiors and colleagues, they may also be harassed by sources. Furthermore, many Spanish publications have a culture of condescension and paternalism, as well as other types of microaggressions.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"es\">Hola, Paco: Recuerdas cuando me entrevistaste para trabajar (sin contrato) y me preguntaste si ten\u00eda novio para a\u00f1adir que en La Raz\u00f3n no nos pod\u00edamos quedar embarazadas porque \u201cesto no es como TV3\u201d?

That\u2019s discrimination. Today journalists are on strike so that doesn\u2019t happen again. Cheers.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Finally, the journalists demonstrated against biases in news coverage. Opinion segments and talk shows are male-centric.\u00a0According to the <a href=\"http://www.agenciasinc.es/Reportajes/Mujeres-ocultas-bajo-un-techo-de-papel\">Global Media Monitoring Project</a>, 91 percent of experts and 82 percent of media spokespeople are men.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"und\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LasPeriodistasParamos?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#LasPeriodistasParamos</a><a href=\"https://t.co/z0GvJbrXcL\">pic.twitter.com/z0GvJbrXcL</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 RadioQHDN (@RadioQHDN) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RadioQHDN/status/971817849298800645?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 8, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"translation\"><p>Tweet reads:\u00a0#WeWomenJournalistsStrike</p>\n<p>Sign in image reads: I can talk about politics and the economy \u2013 stop mansplaining!</p></blockquote>\n<h3><strong>\u00a0\u201cAll we needed was a spark to get out in the street and make our demands.\u201d</strong></h3>\n<p>The movement grew thanks to a group on the instant messaging service Telegram, which, in the days before the strike, facilitated discussions about the mobilization as well as the organization of the online manifesto campaign. It also focused on vetting new members of the group itself, given that one in particular, dedicated to receiving videos, was overrun by trolls who tried (unsuccessfully) to undermine the protest.</p>\n<p>Several of the protest's organizers spoke with Global Voices about the defining characteristics of this protest and the elements that may have contributed to its success. We also asked what makes this occasion unique\u2013why is now the time that people are getting out on the street to fight for these demands?</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/LuciaGlobato\">Luc\u00eda G\u00f3mez \u2013 Lobato</a>: Las periodistas nos hemos conseguido organizar por primera vez, con lo que ello supone de arrastre de medios de comunicaci\u00f3n de todos los colores.

It\u2019s contagious, a snowball effect.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mjromerof\">Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Romero</a>: Solo hemos necesitado una chispa para salir a la calle a reivindicar.

In the case of the journalists, it only took a few women initiating the movement for all of us to dive in headfirst, because the inequalities we face are the same.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/yupiay\">Roc\u00edo Ibarra Arias</a>: Uff creo que ha sido la chispa, como en otras ocasiones.

Pero no s\u00e9, creo que tambi\u00e9n hay una parte de necesidad de la gente de salir a la calle y mediante la uni\u00f3n demostrar que tenemos fuerza y tenemos el poder de cambiar las cosas. Y creo que las Periodistas Paramos ha sido un impulso.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"translation\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/yupiay\">Roc\u00edo Ibarra Arias</a>: I think that was the spark, like other occasions. From my point of view, I think today was the result of an accumulation of injustices and the need to say to one basic one: NO MORE! But I don\u2019t know, I also think part of it was people's need to get out in the street and use the power of numbers to demonstrate that we are strong and we have the power to change things. And I think the journalists\u2019 strike was one of those urges.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/anaoftherock\">Ana de la Pena</a>: Desde mi punto de vista, nosotras cubrimos la actualidad y aqu\u00ed este [a\u00f1o] se han difundido m\u00e1s los casos de violencia machista.

Un caldo de cultivo de muchos a\u00f1os de movilizaci\u00f3n feminista que ha ido calando en los medios y en las calles hasta conseguir vivir lo que hemos vivido hoy.

It's taken many years of feminist mobilization in the media and in the streets to get to where we are today. We've made history. That\u2019s the movement. Keep going.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mar_iona\">Mariona S\u00f2ria</a>: Creo que el \u00e9xito de hoy es que por primera vez se han encontrado la primera generaci\u00f3n de mujeres feministas con las que se acaban de incorporar, que ven que la situaci\u00f3n que les toca vivir e tan nefasta como la de nuestras madres, precariedad, falta de oportunidades, patriarcado latente.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"translation\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mar_iona\">Mariona S\u00f2ria</a>: I think today's success is that the first generation of feminists has united with the newest wave, who are seeing that the situation they live in\u2013precarity, lack of opportunity, and the patriarchy\u2013is just as toxic as that of our mothers.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"http://@KristinaZA\">Kristina Zorita</a>: La cifra de mujeres asesinadas, la manada, una crisis que ha golpeado m\u00e1s a las mujeres, pueden ser parte de la causa.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"translation\"><p><a href=\"http://@KristinaZA\">Kristina Zorita</a>: The number of murdered women, the gang rape, the economic crisis that hit women the hardest\u2013that could all be part of the cause.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/claudiamoran90\">Claudia Mor\u00e1n</a>: Yo creo que los casos medi\u00e1ticos de asesinatos machistas como [el de]\u00a0<a href=\"https://elpais.com/tag/diana_maria_quer_lopez_pinel/a\">Diana Quer</a> y <a href=\"http://micuenta.laopinioncoruna.es/prok/info1/\">el intento de violaci\u00f3n en Boiro</a> tuvieron mucho que ver.

This year there\u2019s also the #metoo movement in Europe and a president talking about making laws to close the wage gap.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The economic crisis that hit Spanish media in 2007-2008 caused a spectacular increase in unemployment among journalists, and the worst affected were women. Unemployment among women in journalism is higher than among men\u201363.8%, to be exact, <a href=\"http://www.apmadrid.es/comunicado/el-45-de-los-periodistas-autonomos-cobra-menos-de-1-000-euros-al-mes-cifra-diez-puntos-superior-que-en-2016/\">according to official data</a>.</p>\n<p>However, more and more women are studying journalism. Six of every 10 students in the field are women, according to the Madrid Press Association\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.apmadrid.es/comunicado/el-45-de-los-periodistas-autonomos-cobra-menos-de-1-000-euros-al-mes-cifra-diez-puntos-superior-que-en-2016/\">report</a> on data from the past four years.</p>\n<p>The historic demonstrations that took place on March 8 open the debate not only on decision-making in the media in Spain, but also on social and economic policies in other job sectors. Fifty years after the feminist slogan, \u201cThe personal is political,\u201d and the civil unrest that took place in May 1968 in France, the new generation of women seems to understand that the cause still needs them.</p>\n</div>",

Can you think of a rule or law that has been widely praised that you might see as unfair to yourself or others? Sometimes we need to look outside our own biases and see that other people can see things quite differently.

He remains head of the\u00a0Direction \u2013 Social Democracy party (Smer-SD), which is part of the ruling coalition.</p>\n<p>Fico claims that his fall from power was triggered not by genuine public outrage over cronyism and injustice, but rather by an orchestrated intervention by\u00a0Hungarian-American businessman and philanthropist George Soros, along with the NGOs funded by Soros foundations, and Slovak President Andrej Kiska, whom Fico alleges is controlled by Soros. He also has accused NGOs of having <a href=\"https://slovensko.hnonline.sk/1770693-nas-nic-nezlomi-fico-poslal-pred-rokovanim-o-migracii-tvrdy-odkaz\">links to organized crime groups.</a></p>\n<p>Soros's advocacy for freedom of expression, government accountability, rule of law and equality has made him a favorite\u00a0right-wing boogeyman. In neighboring Hungary, for example, the parliament\u00a0<a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2018/06/27/with-new-anti-migration-laws-the-space-of-civil-society-in-hungary-continues-to-shrink/\">recently approved a new package of laws</a> dubbed \u201cStop Soros\u201d that criminalize groups who help migrants and tax\u00a0foreign donations to NGOs. (Editor's note: Global Voices is a grantee of the Open Society Foundations, part of the Soros network.)</p>\n<p>Fico has even gone so far as to suggest that NGOs are orchestrating the influx of economic migrants and asylum seekers from Africa and the Middle East into Europe, as a way to foment geopolitical struggle and weaken the European Union:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Pozrite sa, kto sem t\u00fdch migrantov voz\u00ed. S\u00fa to mimovl\u00e1dne organiz\u00e1cie</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"translation\"><p>See who is bringing these migrants here. That are the non-governmental organizations</p></blockquote>\n<p>Fico's former Minister of Interior R\u00f3bert Kali\u0148\u00e1k has said that if journalists really want to know who is behind the migration wave, all they need to do is look at who is financing NGOs.</p>\n<p>The issue of migration, documented and undocumented, has divided members of the European Union roughly in two camps. On one side are countries like Germany which have adopted a comparatively humane approach to accepting those fleeing war and insecurity and are generally pro-immigration as it brings fresh labor and talent into their aging population.</p>\n<p>On the other side are countries like\u00a0Hungary which have steadfastly refused to accept newcomers, claiming it would destroy the fabric of their societies.</p>\n<p>Many NGOs have played an important role in\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.eesc.europa.eu/resources/docs/qe-02-17-304-en-n.pdf\">offering support</a> to\u00a0migrants and asylum seekers, from saving lives on the Mediterranean to helping new arrivals integrate into society and learn their rights and responsibilities.</p>\n<h3>The new prime minister promises tighter NGO regulations</h3>\n<p>Fico's replacement as prime minister has also characterized NGOs as suspicious in light of protests in the country and promised to increase regulations on them.</p>\n<p>Under current Slovakian law, NGOs with an income of more than 200,000 euros must submit financial reports, certified by an auditor, that detail their funding sources and make those reports publicly available. It's not unusual for others with lower incomes to do so voluntary.</p>\n<p>Not all NGOs seem to be held to the same standard, though, in particular those with ties to the government. For instance, in a June 22, 2018 story, the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.aktuality.sk/clanok/600794/fico-sa-chce-pozriet-na-peniaze-mimovladok-pomoze-mu-sns/\">news portal Aktuality.sk noted</a>\u00a0that its journalists could not find any annual report for the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.inst-asa.sk/\">ASA Institute</a>, an NGO affiliated with Fico's Smer-SD party.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.rtvs.sk/radio/archiv/1134/946926\">recent episode of the political discussion program \u201cSaturday dialogues\u201d</a> on Slovak public radio, Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini said he is interested who is behind \u201cFor a decent Slovakia\u201d \u2014 the anti-corruption movement that was born from demonstrations over\u00a0journalist J\u00e1n Kuciak's murder \u2014 and how they are financed.</p>\n<p>A recent \u201cFor a decent Slovakia\u201d gathering, held on 22 June, <a href=\"https://dennikn.sk/1160028/protesty-za-slusne-slovensko-premier-sa-moze-hanbit-tvari-sa-ako-hospodar-co-sadi-zemiaky-ale-farmarov-neprijal/\">had an estimated 6,000-8,000 participants</a>. The prime minister said he did not see any problem in people attending those protests, but that it is necessary to clarify how they operate:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cNetu\u0161\u00edm, pre\u010do organiz\u00e1tori Za slu\u0161n\u00e9 Slovensko op\u00e4\u0165 volali \u013eud\u00ed do ul\u00edc, preto\u017ee ni\u010d tak\u00e9 dramatick\u00e9 sa nestalo, aby bol na to d\u00f4vod.\u201c</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"translation\"><p>I have no idea why the organizers \u201cFor a decent Slovakia\u201d have been calling people to the streets again because nothing so dramatic has happened to give them a reason for it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In reaction, Slovakian blogger Ivan Baltay <a href=\"https://dennikn.sk/blog/1160812/motivacia-2\">criticized Pellegrini and Fico</a>\u00a0for delegitimizing the protests, explaining that participants are\u00a0<a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2018/03/07/slovak-bloggers-and-european-leaders-demand-justice-for-slain-journalist-jan-kuciak/\">demanding justice</a> for slain journalist J\u00e1n Kuciak and his fiancee Martina Ku\u0161n\u00edrov\u00e1:</p>\n<blockquote><p>P\u00e1ni Fico a Pellegrini.

We would like to continue this partnership by streamlining your queries to our relevant ministries.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The text of the ad was also sent to a WhatsApp group of journalists in Papua New Guinea by Marape\u2019s media team, accompanied by an appeal to \u201cwork for the good of our country\u201d and \u201csupport the PM.\u201d The government officer who sent the message <a href=\"https://www.pngreport.com/government/news/1438903/dont-call-me-marape-tells-media\">added</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We are all in this game. It's our country and we need you. Media, you make or break leaders and paint either a good or bad image of your and our children's nation. We all work for the good of our country. Let's not get that wrong \u2026 support the PM. Take back PNG for us all.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A few weeks later, the Prime Minister's Department and the National Executive Council reiterated the requirements that <a href=\"https://postcourier.com.pg/all-foreign-journos-to-be-screened/?fbclid=IwAR1y6c_C-9dw06SaHMqwrwTeWJxzRpG1ZBF0p-QWfg6Rw8ESimFuhNG9gZs\">foreign journalists need to submit</a> before they are allowed entry into the country. This involves seeking permits from several offices such as the Department of Foreign Affairs, PNG Immigration &amp; Citizenship Authority, PNG National Filming Institute, and the Prime Minister's Department.</p>\n<p>Post-Courier published an editorial <a href=\"https://postcourier.com.pg/do-not-suppress-foreign-journos/?fbclid=IwAR2HYX141z7WOI9-JeIoA7LI9RgNL13WPCPhTVQ4M7hge8833641droSNVU\">criticizing the requirements</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u2026the requirements appear to be ludicrous and an affront to media freedom in PNG.</p>\n<p>We ask the simple question, what have we got to hide from public scrutiny?</p>\n<p>Our foreign friends should not be turned away on some ridiculous belief that they may stumble on some hidden secret that will unplug the government.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It also suggested that the new media rules could be linked to the government\u2019s refusal to address sensitive topics like <a href=\"https://www.pngattitude.com/2022/09/corruption-is-suffocating-economic-growth.html\">corruption</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If the government is serious, it should allow its ministers to be interviewed regularly by foreign and PNG media on a weekly basis on issues of interest to the nation including why corruption remains the biggest stumbling block to development in PNG.</p>\n<p>We cannot be seen as a nation that is suddenly turning against the most powerful source of information in the world \u2013 journalism!</p></blockquote>\n<p>But Department of Prime Minister and National Executive Council Secretary Ivan Pomaleu <a href=\"http://www.pmnec.gov.pg/index.php/secretariats/pm-media-statements/594-pomaleu-clarifies-journalist-visa-for-foreign-media-to-png\">clarified that the republication of the rules</a> was only meant to facilitate the visa processing of foreign journalists.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It is in no way, in its message disseminated yesterday to the mainstream media, implying a recent intention to restrict foreign media from traveling to PNG.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A long-time blogger in PNG has a reminder for authorities who want to restrict the work of foreign journalists:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">There are few foreign journalists in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PNG?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#PNG</a>, maybe 2 or 3. Others visit for short assignments.</p>\n<p>And Mr Marape should know that journalists will write stories about PNG whether they visit there or not.</p>\n<p>\u2014 Keith Jackson AM (@PNGAttitude) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PNGAttitude/status/1574666511373176833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 27, 2022</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>The International Federation of Journalists took notice of the new media rules and <a href=\"https://www.ifj.org/media-centre/news/detail/category/press-releases/article/papua-new-guinea-prime-minister-limits-journalist-communication-threatens-restrictions.html\">urged the government to work closely with the press</a> and promote the public\u2019s right to information:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As press freedom continues to decline across the Pacific, any restriction on journalists is a concerning development. The IFJ urges Prime Minister Marape and Papua New Guinea\u2019s government to maintain press freedom and due consultation with the media, and allow journalists full and unfettered access to government proceedings.</p></blockquote>\n</div>",

        "content": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>On December 31, 2019, Carlos Ghosn, disgraced former head of automakers Nissan and Renault, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lisadont/status/1211850051158282241\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> he had broken the conditions of his bail and had fled Japan for Lebanon. Details of his flight from Japan were slow to emerge over the year-end holiday period, and various theories of Ghosn's escape have included the help of a former Green Beret soldier, passing through border security in an oversize musical instrument case, and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/petesweeneypro/status/1211852142941589504\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">covert help of the Japanese government itself</a>, who wanted to be rid of the one-time Japanese corporate titan for once and for all.</p>\n<p>In reality, Ghosn seems to have taken advantage of systemic shortcomings in Japan's police and prosecution services, the judicial system, passport security, ports control and more.</p>\n<p>Ghosn had been released on bail and then confined to house arrest in March 2019 after being originally arrested in Japan in November 2018 on suspicion of <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-20/questions-swirl-over-what-felled-ghosn-as-property-deals-raised?cmpid=BBD112018_OUS\">fraud</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/19/nissan-renault-carlos-ghosn-arrest-shares\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tax evasion</a>, violating securities laws and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Ghosn#Initial_arrest\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">other allegations</a>. At the time of his arrest in late 2018, Ghosn was chairperson of Japanese car company Nissan and its partner <a href=\"https://europe.autonews.com/blogs/renault-nissan-dead-all-name\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Renault</a>, and had been accused of illegally diverting funds from Nissan for his <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/2175124/ousted-nissan-chairman-ghosn-accused-using-business-jet-personal\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">personal use</a>.</p>\n<p>Since helping rescue Nissan from bankruptcy in 1999, Ghosn, a Brazilian-born French citizen with Lebanese ancestry had become one of Japan's most recognizable business personalities. Following his initial success with Nissan, Ghosn would eventually become chair of the world\u2019s second-biggest carmaker, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault%E2%80%93Nissan%E2%80%93Mitsubishi_Alliance#Conflict_over_control\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance</a>, after setting up an infusion of cash to Nissan from French carmaker Renault, and then a partnership between the two companies. In 2016, Ghosn then helped Nissan take control of another struggling Japanese automaker, <a href=\"https://europe.autonews.com/article/20161020/ANE/161029998/nissan-takes-control-of-mitsubishi-with-ghosn-as-chairman\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mitsubishi</a>, further establishing his influence in Japan's automotive industry.</p>\n<h3>A corporate titan persecuted by Japanese \u2018hostage justice\u2019</h3>\n<p>Ghosn's arrest by Japanese prosecutors in November 2018 <a href=\"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2018/12/01/issues/carlos-ghosns-arrest-japanese-criminal-justice-corporate-governance/#.XhPUGUdKhhE\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">has shone an international spotlight</a> on the perceived harshness of Japan's justice system. After being arrested, Ghosn was <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Cover-Story/Ghosn-scandal-puts-spotlight-on-Japan-s-judicial-system\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">legally</a> detained for 23 days without charges in a bare cell, and with no contact to the outside world. Following the end of the 23-day period, Ghosn continued to be detained in December 2018 without charge following additional allegations.</p>\n<p>After finally being formally charged in court in January, Ghosn would then be denied release and would for several more months endure what some have called Japan's \u201c<a href=\"https://apnews.com/a1dccb42110d46b3936a5149b15e0cc2\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hostage justice</a>\u201d for refusing to confess to charges brought against him by prosecutors.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ghosn?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Ghosn</a> was wearing a workman\u2019s uniform, face mask, blue cap and glasses when he slipped out of the Tokyo Detention House and got into a minicar unrecognized by many of the journalists camped outside.\n(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Reuters?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Reuters</a> photos by Issei Kato \u2066<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Hirame1972?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Hirame1972</a>\u2069) <a href=\"https://t.co/IbKK9onfyl\">https://t.co/IbKK9onfyl</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 William Mallard (@BillyMallard) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BillyMallard/status/1103213624301039616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 6, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Ghosn was finally granted bail in Tokyo on March 6, 2019, and attempted to evade waiting reporters and paparazzi by disguising himself as a masked maintenance worker.

Ghosn possesses Brazilian, Lebanese and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deivudesu/status/1213786138281775105\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">multiple French passports</a> and was permitted to retain one of his French passports to conform with Japanese immigration rules (so far, France has denied Ghosn used a French passport, but Lebanon says he did to enter the country).</p>\n<p>Retaining a passport made it easier for Ghosn to legally enter Lebanon, which has\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/01/02/accused-serious-crimes-he-smuggled-himself-out-japan-carlos-ghosn-may-escape-extradition-lebanon-too/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">no extradition treaty</a> with Japan.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">If it turns out a key part of Ghosn's escape was him having one of his passports, I wonder whether he could have been issued some other form of ID to satisfy domestic law. <a href=\"https://t.co/27hud7HFYQ\">pic.twitter.com/27hud7HFYQ</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Mulboyne (@Mulboyne) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mulboyne/status/1213675210513084416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 5, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Ghosn was able to travel undetected by taxi and bullet train to Kansai International Airport, 430 kilometers from Tokyo (at one point during his escape <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GearoidReidy/status/1214844767424483328\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">he nearly encountered Japanese prime minister Abe Shinzo</a>). His ease in evading house arrest highlighted Japan's relatively lackadaisical attitude towards monitoring Ghosn:\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BillyMallard/status/1212965472011878400\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">security camera footage</a> actually showed him departing for the airport, but the footage is only reviewed by Japanese courts <a href=\"https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/japan-vows-to-improve-border-checks-bail-after-ghosn-escape-1.4754178\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">once a month</a>. The prosecution service, rather than local police, <a href=\"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2018/12/01/issues/carlos-ghosns-arrest-japanese-criminal-justice-corporate-governance/#.XhPUGUdKhhE\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">was responsible</a> for enforcing Ghosn's arrest, and there seems to have been little coordination between different government agencies.</p>\n<p>This disorganization among authorities made it easier for Ghosn to get through airport security. Ghosn apparently chose Kansai International Airport (KIX) because of a special terminal <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Nissan-s-Ghosn-crisis/Ghosn-escape-leaves-Kansai-Airport-officials-scratching-heads\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reserved for government and industry VIPs</a>. Border control at the airport may have not been alerted about restrictions on Ghosn's travel. There is also the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/plotters-exploited-airport-security-hole-in-ghosns-escape-11578270953\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">theory</a> that Ghosn did indeed smuggle himself out in a large box of some kind that was allowed to <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Nissan-s-Ghosn-crisis/Case-allegedly-hiding-Ghosn-wasn-t-X-rayed-at-airport\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">bypass security</a> at the VIP terminal at KIX after checking into a hotel near the airport.</p>\n<h3>Little Japanese government can do with Ghosn safe in Lebanon</h3>\n<p>It took the Japanese government a week to issue an official response. Initially, Japan's Justice Minister Mori Masako<a href=\"https://twitter.com/natfukue/status/1214003530815590401\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\u00a0could neither confirm nor deny</a> any <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GearoidReidy/status/1214003609869770753\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">details</a> about Ghosn's escape. Mori would later announce that Ghosn's 9 million USD bail had been <a href=\"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/01/05/national/crime-legal/japan-justice-minister-unjustifiable-carlos-ghosn-escape/#.XhTtn0dKhhE\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">revoked</a>, that the government had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/39981432-2e46-11ea-bc77-65e4aa615551\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">notified Interpol</a>\u00a0to request his arrest, and that immigration checks would be <a href=\"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/01/06/national/crime-legal/carlos-ghosn-criminal-prosecution/#.XhTtpkdKhhE\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tightened</a>. Japan has also issued an <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/01/07/carole-ghosn-carlos-ghosns-wife-subject-japan-arrest-warrant/2831959001/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">arrest warrant</a> for Carole Ghosn for her alleged role in Ghosn's escape.</p>\n<p>In the wake of Ghosn's escape, Japan commentators have argued that the country's exceedingly harsh treatment of Ghosn <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Colin_P_A_Jones/status/1213965054938251265\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">may have been reason enough</a> for his flight. Other's have noted that what makes Ghosn's treatment so shocking is the privileges the business elite generally enjoy in other parts of the world when accused of breaking the law <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SublightMonster/status/1212185216019623937\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">compared to regular folk</a>.</p>\n<p>David McNeill, the Economist's Japan correspondent, suggests it's possible to believe both things at the same time:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Is it so hard to accept that Carlos Ghosn is a grasping boss who muddied the boundaries between his personal finances and those of Nissan, and that his detention highlights epic flaws in Japan's criminal justice system?

        "content": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>The lush, tree-filled backyard of <a href=\"https://www.jamaicaartsociety.com/jasmine-thomas-girvan#:~:text=Jasmine%20Thomas%2DGirvan%20was%20born,of%20Design%20in%20New%20York.\">Jamacian-born, Trinidad-based</a> artist <a href=\"https://www.jasminethomasgirvan.com/\">Jasmine Thomas-Girvan</a>\u2018s urban childhood home was to have an impact on her creative process that she could never have imagined when she first received her Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the groundbreaking <a href=\"https://www.newschool.edu/parsons/\">Parsons School of Design</a> in the 1980s. Over the course of her long career, her work has expanded from amazingly intricate jewellery pieces to large-scale installations that merge sculpture with elements of multimedia.</p>\n<p>In her latest <a href=\"https://sour-grass.com/kunstinstituut-melly\">solo exhibition</a> at <a href=\"https://www.kunstinstituutmelly.nl/en/\">Kunstinstituut Melly</a> in The Netherlands, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.kunstinstituutmelly.nl/nl/experience/128-jasmine-thomas-girvan-bathed-in-sacred-fire\">Bathed in Sacred Fire</a>,\u201d Thomas-Girvan takes those natural elements that <a href=\"https://www.jasminethomasgirvan.com/biography/\">made such an impression</a> on her in her youth and uses them to launch a discussion about Caribbean identity. Her art deftly strips bare the region's traumatic colonial past, presenting it in such hauntingly beautiful and empowering ways that you dare not look away, lest you miss a precious and powerful detail.</p>\n\n<p>Neither is her commentary monolithic. Instead, it oozes the kind of magical realism that allows us to connect with experiences of indigenous Africa, with the horrors of the Middle Passage and slavery, all the way to postcolonial sociopolitical issues and race relations at play in the Americas. None of it feels preachy; instead, each piece portrays tangibility and truth in a very personal way. It's a raw, tender examination of ancestry with a distinctly contemporary artistic approach.</p>\n<p>Thomas-Girvan's love of literature adds further context to the exhibit, as quotes by poets like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_Senior\">Olive Senior</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octavio_Paz\">Octavio Paz</a> hover on the wall space behind certain pieces. Via email, I interviewed the artist about her vision for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfHWa1SUp3o&amp;t=3s\">this exhibit</a> and what she wants people to take away from it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Janine Mendes-Franco (JMF): One of the things I love most about your art is that it\u2019s fearless. You\u2019re not afraid to experiment and take risks, whether it be with materials, subject matter, or even how you combine them to make a statement. Where does that come from and how does it inform your art\u2014especially when you\u2019re trying to say something difficult?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Jasmine Thomas-Girvan (JTG):</strong> James Hillman said, \u2018The great task of any culture is to keep the invisibles attached.\u2019 Trying to locate the \u2018invisibles\u2019 excite me! There are so many questions for which I am seeking understanding and so this is my work. I want to rigorously delve into this challenge. I am interested in the insidious psychic dissonance of the colonial project and, as a believer in lifelong learning, being satisfied with the status quo for me is to surrender to fear. If you only create from a comfortable familiar place you don\u2019t grow. Without taking risks and pushing boundaries, my art would remain stagnant and my creative spirit would have been wasted on my fears.</p>\n<p>This curiosity feeds my experimentation.I feel frustration with the gulf in my knowledge of our heritage. My most recent work considers the indigenous heritage of the wider Caribbean, particularly Taino and African cosmology. This work is a tool for reflection, exhuming the forgotten mysteries of the Indigenous and African presence by creating visual poetry in sculpture that is saturated with metaphors, motifs and materials that celebrate our First Peoples. I purposefully use materials [feathers, shells, stone, gourds, seeds, wood, bones and architectural detritus] that I find in the environment to reinforce my connection to specific geography.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>JMF: You see artistic potential in found or natural elements, combining hard and soft materials in a breathtaking way and skilfully making seemingly dissonant materials bend to your will. Tell us about the process of working with such a disparate range of elements.</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>JTG:</strong> I often feel I am bending to the will of the materials, as often the materials present themselves in alignment with my practice. Over time, I have learnt to be patient and to allow works to evolve organically. This comes from a deep respect for materials, process and the acceptance of failure as an integral part of this process. The use of seemingly disparate materials is faithful to our hybrid stories. I believe the \u2018dissonant\u2019 material choices help magnify these complex narratives. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audre_Lorde\">Audre Lorde</a>\u2018s words, \u201c[\u2026] for the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house,\u201d come to mind. I am always looking for alternative implements to communicate things which are idiosyncratic, ephemeral, enigmatic and incomprehensible to \u2018rectify the wilful blindness of colonialism.\u2019 I seek appropriate materials to resolve my investigations. [\u2026] I have learnt to respect the integrity of disparate elements and to trust their innate offerings. [\u2026] Our history is dissonant, so the redeeming/redreaming of it should reflect this tension\u2014a tension demanding us to change the context by reshaping the interpretation of historical truths.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>JMF: As a Caribbean person, the subject matter feels familiar to me. How much do regional folklore and oral tradition contribute to this, and what have non-regional audiences been taking away?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>JTG:</strong> Yes, the work has its taproots in Caribbean history, folklore, spirituality and music. The colonisers tried to annihilate anything that posed a threat to their dominion, ruthlessly eliminating our culture in overt and covert ways. But we not only survived, but thrived. This was possible through remote realms over which they had no control\u2014[traditions and rituals that] help[ed] to preserve our culture. Though the details are specific to the Caribbean, the archetypes are replicated across cultures and geographies, so people identify with the universal themes [\u2026] in the pieces. Maybe that is the point: that people will see the similarities, appreciate the differences and emerge with a better understanding of self and humanity. I see the work as a trigger of experience, and my hope is that viewers will be motivated to seek out further information.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>JMF: Which is your favourite piece in this exhibit and why?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>JTG:</strong> I was going say I have no favourites, but on reflection I would have to say the three sculptures: \u2018Scanning every horizon,\u2019 \u2018The Field Beyond,\u2019 and \u2018Inside the Labyrinth-Gyan Chaupar.\u2019 These wax models were very badly damaged in transit to the foundry and seemed beyond redemption! But I could not allow many months of work to be negated by <a href=\"https://tidal.com/magazine/article/behind-babylon/1-73444\">Babylon</a>! I was determined to complete the series. The process by which they came into being gave deeper significance to the title \u2018Bathed in Sacred Fire.\u2019 The reimagining, remaking, reconstituting the pieces conjured up <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2017/03/17/after-planting-the-caribbean-in-our-collective-imagination-sir-derek-walcott-one-of-the-great-poets-of-all-time-has-died/\">Derek Walcott</a>\u2018s words from <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1992/walcott/lecture/\">Fragments of Epic Memory</a>: \u2018Antillean Art is the restoration of our shattered histories, our shards, our vocabulary, our archipelago becoming a synonym for pieces broken off from the original continent.\u2019</p>\n<p>The possibility of seeing beyond the immediate catastrophe and bringing all energies to bear on repair and wholeness, literally piecing together the shattered fragments that represent the Epic memory\u2014our heritage, in the present reaching into the past for healing\u2014was profound. As I sat working in the busy foundry workshop in Tiel, the radio was blasting European pop music until suddenly, I was reassured by the mystical, familiar voice of <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2018/02/08/as-the-world-celebrates-bob-marley-day-reggae-is-changing-and-so-are-its-fans/\">Bob Marley</a> singing, \u2018Don\u2019t worry bout a ting [\u2026] every lickle ting gonna be alright,\u2019 mysteriously reaching out over the airways, through time and space, connecting past and present, the natural mystic, the balm of ancestral guidance. I will never forget the synchronicity of [that] moment!</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>JMF: Your piece \u201cAncestral Anguish,\u201d for instance, has beauty and power in pain. In a region that finds it difficult to talk productively and dispassionately about colonialism and its effects, how can we use art and its spaces to begin to have useful discussions that carry through into how we operate in Caribbean societies?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>JTG:</strong> There are many deeply entrenched attitudes from our colonial past that continue to poison how we view ourselves and our citizenry. \u2018Ancestral Anguish\u2019 speaks specifically to the <a href=\"https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/latestnews/Another_girl_gone_missing_in_Bath,_St_Thomas\">disappearance of young girls</a> in Jamaica. Who is <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2014/09/04/eve-for-life-nuh-guh-deh-campaign-against-sexual-abuse-international-day-girl-child/\">preying on</a> these young ones? Some things have not changed and the trafficking of black bodies continues. We need to not only honestly interrogate these exploitative systems but courageously situate ourselves within it. \u2018The Table\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.kunstinstituutmelly.nl/en/engage/882-session-laying-a-table-for-the-ancestors\">exposes</a> the exploitation of blackbodies in the context of the luxury that it afforded slaveowners. The rise of European economies was only possible because of the vulgar profits derived from Plantation Slavery. As colonial subjects, our tastes and aspirations are still intimately tethered to the habits of the plantation [and] our addiction to a particular lifestyle [\u2026] continue to enable those exploitative systems.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>JMF: Your use of glass fascinates me. There\u2019s one photograph of \u201cThe Table,\u201d which shows the glass figure bent forward at an angle where her head appears to be cut off\u2014but the head in the centre of \u201cAncestral Anguish,\u201d directly behind it, dramatically fills this negative space with a rippling red aura. The crystalline nature of the glass offers an almost eternal connection and continuity between the two pieces, yet it is also fragile. Are there parallels here with the bigger discussion of the colonial legacy?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>JTG:</strong> This is what really charges an Art work\u2014when the viewer animates it with their own eyes, presence and heart tapping into those \u2018eternal connections.\u2019 The glass figure is bowed looking inwards, suggesting introspection. Under the skirt is a delicate glass web under which <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anansi\">Anansi</a> is sheltering. The glass represents our fragile but formidable selves, where Anansi prevails. What you are describing is the replacement of the individual head with that of our ancestors, a potent magnetic field emanating into infinity. This rippling aura that you describe is for me \u2018all the restless wayward spirits of all the aeons\u2019 that <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2018/03/16/guyanese-literary-giant-sir-wilson-harris-leaves-behind-a-literacy-of-the-imagination/\">Wilson Harris</a> speaks of so eloquently in <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2019/03/08/a-palace-on-stilts-guyanese-novelist-wilson-harris-returns-to-life-in-trinidad-tobagos-carnival/\">Palace of the Peacock</a>.</p>\n<p>[He says they] \u2018are returning to roost in our blood. And we have to start all over again where they began to explore. We\u2019ve got to pick up the seeds again where they left off. [\u2026] We\u2019ve got to face it. Or else it will be too late to stop everything and everyone from running away and tumbling down. And then all the kings and all the kings\u2019 men won\u2019t be able to put us together again. This new independence is insubstantial top-soil; the real battle is below.\u2019</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>JMF: This is not a sugar-coated exhibit, but it does feel hopeful. How do you believe we will overcome? </strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>JTG:</strong> The real battle is below and within.</p></blockquote>\n</div>",

It is good to remind the people of the past so bad things that happened do not happen again for instance. Not every culture has a fairy tale history to fall back on and remember fondly. This artist is taking an opportunity to educate and remind people of not only what has happened, but what CAN happen even though hard times came before, without buffering it or softening it to comfort the masses. It is inspirational in my opinion to see this artist take such care to do such a thing that way. It gives people a glimpse into how the Caribbean that we know today got to where it is.",

        "content": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>A digital illustrated novel tells the stories of Indonesian Chinese who were attacked during the riots that toppled the Indonesian government in 1998.</p>\n<p>In May 1998, violent riots erupted across Indonesia demanding the resignation of then President Suharto who had ruled the country for over three decades. The riots led to a change in government but thousands of innocent civilians \u2014 in particular, Indonesians of Chinese ancestry\u2013 were injured, raped, and killed. Many\u00a0Orang Tionghoa (how Indonesians with full or partial Chinese ancestry are called) fled the country because of the escalating violence that targeted them.</p>\n<p>A government <a href=\"http://semanggipeduli.com/tgpf/bab6.html\">report</a> released in October 1998 revealed that, while some violent incidents against Indonesian Chinese were spontaneous, most cases appeared to be systematically planned by local thugs supported by powerful political and military forces. The report also documented cases of rape that victimized many Indonesian Chinese women.</p>\n<p>After two decades, victims of the attacks in 1998 and their families continue to <a href=\"https://www.cnnindonesia.com/nasional/20160514164756-20-130671/jangan-ingkari-kekerasan-seksual-pada-tragedi-mei-1998\">seek</a> justice.</p>\n<p>Written by Melbourne-based artist Rani Pramesti, the <a href=\"https://thechinesewhispers.com/\">\u2018Chinese Whispers\u2019</a> illustrated novel narrates the tragedy that forced her to flee her beloved country in 1998. It also features the stories of women who witnessed the 1998 riots.</p>\n<p>Global Voices interviewed her about the novel and her motivation for initiating this project:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Chinese Whispers was inspired by my personal experiences of how the May 1998 racial violence impacted my sense of identity as well as by the historical context of May 1998.</p>\n<p>I noticed how 1998 became an important unspoken issue (among) Chinese Indonesian diaspora in Australia.</p>\n<p>I can\u2019t speak for other people\u2019s experiences. But I can speak about mine. My family and I were spared from (the) 1998 looting, rape, and violence but we lived the era where we were subjected to politically motivated racism. Being raised unequivocally Indonesian, a proud one that is, the 1998 riot questioned my identity.</p>\n<p>Through the Chinese Whispers, I want to reveal what politically motivated racism (PMR) could do to people, (and it) doesn\u2019t matter how many years after it happened. PMR has real human costs, not just in Indonesia but the entire world today.</p></blockquote>\n<p>She explained why she chose the title \u2018Chinese Whispers\u2019 for her novel:</p>\n<blockquote><p>During the creative process with the community, we talked about many things and everything. Yet, when I brought up the events that took place in 1998, of our whereabouts and what not, the voices in the room were reduced to whispers.</p>\n<p>As a student of dramatic arts, I learned to observe tones, body languages, expressions. What I came across during the meetings and dramatic workshops, 1998 held a certain significance to the community.</p>\n<p>Many said that the 1998 riot is something taboo to talk about. It remains sensitive, it\u2019s hard to talk about the events, but taboo\u2019s not the word to describe it.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And this is what she hopes her work will accomplish:</p>\n<blockquote><p>One day I attended a poetry reading by Mark Gonzales, one of his poems reads \u201cWe cannot heal what we will not face.\u201d That rang true to me.</p>\n<p>20 years on, 1998 is barely acknowledged. There [are] a lot of things to be done in terms of healing, to obtain some forms of justice. I\u2019m not only talking about healing at the personal level, but also as a nation.</p>\n<p>I want my readers to remember what 1998 entails and to be moved by the experiences of individuals who went through it.</p>\n<p>In my work, my 12-year-old persona experienced having her identity torn apart by politically motivated racism.</p>\n<p>I love how dramatic arts contributed in telling my personal stories. After all, despite the macro stories we hear everywhere, in the end, we are all human beings, we all have our micro stories and that is how we connect at the most profound level \u2014 from one person to another.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Currently, the Chinese Whispers is available in Indonesian. Its English version is due out by the end of 2018. Rani's work can be found on her <a href=\"https://www.cnnindonesia.com/nasional/20160514164756-20-130671/jangan-ingkari-kekerasan-seksual-pada-tragedi-mei-1998\">website</a> and she can be reached through her Facebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Ranipnews/\">page</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ranipnews/\">Instagram</a>.</p>\n</div>",

The two-headed banded kukri is only the third twin-headed snake documented in Nepal. The first dicephalic snake \u2013 a juvenile checkered keelback (<em>Fowlea piscator</em>) \u2013 was documented by Mishra and Shah in 1983, while the second case \u2013 a common krait (<em>Bungarus caeruleus</em>) \u2013 was found in May 2018 in the Kawasoti Municipality of Nawalpur District in central Nepal.

In my decade-long career, I have found other interesting cases of snakes but you always don't get what you want. Likewise, these dicephalic snakes are found opportunistically while surveying snakes rather than following any specific methods.</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Devkota, up to 90 snake species have been recorded by various authors in Nepal, among which 18 are considered venomous. While many people, especially in the lowlands of Nepal, die of snakebites every year, a snake has its own role in the ecosystem added Devkota who has been working on human-snake conflict mitigation.</p>\n<blockquote><p>[A snake] plays a vital role to maintain the food web in nature. It also helps to increase the farmer's productivity in the field by eating mice, frogs and other harmful insects. From snake venom, we can produce many different types of medicine, including anti-venom.</p></blockquote>\n</div>",

If it was pollution changing things, it would be more wide spread and in different areas. A possible cause to this could just be inbreeding. We're talking a few snakes, not even a few hundred. However, Davis, you are correct about the effects of pollution  but that can take upwards of years to manifest. Let's not blow things out of proportion and assume that every new oddity of nature is a direct result of pollution. Nature is just full of surprises sometimes!",

It's hard to believe that Jacobson knows what he is talking about when he claims such a thing that can easily be proven wrong. Comparing both conclusions, you really don't know what to believe.

The focus is always on the women who are battered by their partners but the number one reason of suicide for men is domestic violence with 1 out of 7 men (that's 13.8%) have been assaulted by their partners at some point in their life per NCADV. This is something we need to look at closely and carefully because it is an alarming statistic. Sure, traditionally speaking, domestic violence has long been associated with female victims. That's not incorrect, there are way too many of those but it's not completely correct and cover the whole scope of domestic violence victims. We need to hear from all victims, men and women. Doing it will not discredit the female voices, but will enrich the concept of justice when we see all sexes be held accountable.  This battle should be a shared one so no one is left behind and all voices are heard loud and clear!",

He's not religious, so I am not sure what he would know about anything ingrained in the religion so how can we trust what he says? One would think that a cultural shift would end all the violence. In contrast, an Islamic religion expert and devote Islamic follower, Ali Mustafa, claims it is not solely a generational problem but an education and opportunity issue. His perspective, although different, seems to carry more weight. Isn't it apt to believe that a man who lives within the system could provide more insight on how the system works?",

Then, on the eve of the first of three planned weekend lockdowns, news that a young woman <a href=\"https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/latestnews/UPDATE:_Body_of_accounting_clerk_was_in_state_of_decomposition?fbclid=IwAR0VrSgiyeaOgIJHvQCKVkUJJVQlI4lqbLsVg7dnA8UOMn9OrOD_6dUGXGg\">had been found</a> murdered two days after she went missing hit a raw nerve.</p>\n<p>Police <a href=\"http://jamaica-star.com/article/news/20210330/fifty-year-old-mechanic-charged-murder-khanice-jackson\">have charged</a> a 50-year-old man, a neighbour, with the murder of 20-year-old accounting clerk Khanice Jackson, who left her suburban Kingston home on the morning of March 24, but never arrived at her workplace. The suspect would reportedly give her a lift in his car quite regularly, as their workplaces were close to each other.</p>\n<p>News of Jackson's murder came against the backdrop of a record number of murders on the island which, according to one 2020 survey, <a href=\"https://insightcrime.org/news/analysis/2020-homicide-round-up/\">had the highest homicide rate</a> in Latin America and the Caribbean, at 46.5 per 100,000 people.

A week after she was found, the cloud of gloom had hardly lifted, especially among young women, one of whom shared her feelings of insecurity for herself and others:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Today just feel heavy from morning\u2026cried while driving\u2026 got home and just made sad again.

Are the often violent dancehall lyrics merely a reflection of society, or are they actually influencing young people to act criminally?</p>\n<p>Twitter user Wayne Chen reminded social media users that the prime minister also repeatedly decries the continued prevalence of corporal punishment in Jamaican families, which he believes helps fuel a culture of violence:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">When will we agree..that if we beat our children mercilessly we are teaching them that the only way to resolve conflict is with violence..that a person\u2019s body is inviolable..that I have a right for you not to touch me..that every woman has a right to say no?</p>\n<p>- PM Andrew Holness</p>\n<p>\u2014 Wayne Chen (@wcchen) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wcchen/status/1377242844377853952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 31, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>In that vein, concerns about parenting and family structures also resurfaced. Olympic medalist Shelly-Ann Fraser Pryce commented on the way that boys are raised in Jamaica:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Stop raising boys like they are entitled to women or it\u2019s ok for them to \u201cget away with things because they are boys.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u2014 ShellyAnnFraserPryce (@realshellyannfp) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realshellyannfp/status/1375524482127826946?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 26, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>But why are women targeted? The perception is that many fall victim to jealous, abusive (and sometimes estranged) partners. Victim blaming after instances of femicide also surfaces from time to time. Jamaican women feel they have seen and heard it all before. Earlier this year, the women's organisation <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/wechangeja/?hl=en\">WeChange</a>, in a newspaper op-ed, pointed to the endless cycle of outrage, promises and inaction, <a href=\"https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/editorial/call-femicide-by-its-name_184844?profile=1468\">challenging Jamaicans</a> to \u201ccall femicide by its name\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When will they stop talking? When will they act? Importantly, when will we stop normalising the toxic nature of relationships and the idea that entering into a relationship means we become the property of our partners? Our society continues to cling to these harmful justifications for men's violence; from controlling women's ability to making personal choices to using jealousy to justify dangerous actions and defining gender roles in the household where the man is \u2018king of the castle\u2019.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In a heated parliamentary sitting on March 30, one Member of Parliament <a href=\"http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/lead-stories/20210331/too-easy-killers\">railed against</a> sentencing practices. In Jamaica, convicted criminals receive a reduction in their sentence if they plead guilty (an attempt to clear a huge backlog of cases in court). Justice Minister Delroy Chuck, however, said that this practice was not appropriate in all cases and that the matter would have to be revisited.</p>\n<p>One television station reported that the prime minister, in an interview, said that \u201cextraordinary and emergency powers\u201d may have to be implemented to curb crime, while respecting citizens\u2019 rights. However, he provided no further details:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Prime Minister Andrew Holness says more States of Public Emergency and Zones of Special Operation will have to be implemented to curtail crime in Jamaica. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TVJPTN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TVJPTN</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/wIvUycnqyU\">pic.twitter.com/wIvUycnqyU</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 TVJ (@televisionjam) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/televisionjam/status/1377416081065697280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 1, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Such strategies are <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/specialcoverage/2010-special-coverage/jamaica-state-of-emergency-2010/\">not new</a>\u2014and often cause the state great expense down the line, both financially and in terms of public opinion, when <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2017/08/12/jamaica-police-review-absolves-officers-in-tivoli-gardens-incursion/\">commissions of enquiry</a> are necessary to determine whether people's rights have been trampled upon.</p>\n<p>So, how can Jamaican women defend themselves? The legalisation of <a href=\"http://jamaica-star.com/article/news/20210331/sharp-rise-pepper-spray-demand\">pepper spray</a> was raised by Opposition Leader Mark Golding, although it appears that its use remains contentious. A petition on the Office of the Prime Minister's website to make pepper spray legal <a href=\"https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/front-page/support-for-pepper-spray-online-petition-surpasses-15-000-target_218137\">quickly gathered signatures</a> and will now be considered by parliament.</p>\n<p>Even as more women <a href=\"https://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/lead-stories/20210402/hope-and-hand-wringing-missing-clarendon-teacher\">go missing</a>, <a href=\"https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/crime-hits-home-for-dj-treasure_218169?profile=1116\">many Jamaicans</a> are publicly expressing their dismay at the crime situation.</p>\n<p>Columnist Jean Lowrie-Chin <a href=\"https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/opinion/women-under-siege-here-and-abroad_218112?profile=1096\">reminded the nation of another pending case</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Meanwhile, the courts are in the process of sentencing Jermaine Miller, who is convicted of the murder of his former girlfriend, Nevia Sinclair, at her parents\u2019 home last year. What is it about these men who will not allow a woman to go in peace if she wants to end the relationship?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Despite all the hand-wringing, genuine grief, and heightened fear, will anything change? One Jamaican woman believes that, as was the case with other victims before them, the outrage will blow over and it will be back to \u201cnormal\u201d for most:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Tomorrow when the dust settles and the uproar quiets, we\u2019re right back to square one. We\u2019ll all go back to our lives, women will continue to live in fear and men will continue to be predators. We\u2019ve been here one too many times, nothing will change.

Taking this line can lead to unforeseen consequences, as things can get out of control very quickly. First, they will be given the right to use pepper spray, but what comes after that? Perhaps blackjacks. And then? Maybe tasers. And after that? Probably guns. And then there would be a troubling new layer of violence in Jamaica. This kind of approach to solving problems can evolve rapidly and get away from you, eventually creating a whole new set of problems.

How about actually getting to the root of the problem that is causing all these murders? We need to create a whole range of programs that address violence and allows us to learn how this problem is engrained in the society at a young age. We all can be a part of this solution, by talking to those around us and making sure that everyone learns through love and empathy.

Sexism is among these biases and one of the most dangerous. [\u2026] the words and actions of our politicians have been <a href=\"https://www.looptt.com/content/4-times-prime-minister-offended-women?fbclid=IwAR38-pAUbsMUbYC-Zbo1vvpvLucmct1FgieMltonaq2NyIIZL4PUlieN1SE\">well documented</a> by local media, the legacy of which informs what is deemed acceptable behaviour for those in authority and continues to haunt us today. In the midst of the 2020 general election campaign, it is clear that this problem persists.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The statement identified certain issues the group saw as problematic, including the nomination of a candidate currently facing <a href=\"https://newsday.co.tt/2020/07/10/pnm-womens-league-reject-watson-duke-as-a-candidate/\">sexual assault charges</a>; another who has had \u201conline allegations involving sexual offences\u201d being <a href=\"https://trinidadexpress.com/elections/2020/politics/falsehoods/article_f5a0d0de-ca30-11ea-985b-bf1d447ee1cb.html\">levelled</a> against him; and a third who has had an interim protection order <a href=\"https://www.guardian.co.tt/news/woman-takes-out-protection-order-against-gypsy-6.2.1159248.d67437a50b\">taken out</a> against him by a former partner. </p>\n<p>No judgement has yet been handed down on the rape charge, no formal charges have been made against the candidate accused of sexual offences, and the protection order against the third candidate <a href=\"https://www.guardian.co.tt/news/woman-takes-out-protection-order-against-gypsy-6.2.1159248.d67437a50b\">expired on July 23</a>, upon which he was due to appear in court regarding the matter.   </p>\n<p>Womantra <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/womantra/institutional-failure-and-political-nastiness-no-patriarchy-in-my-politics/1690057704483230/\">described</a> these as \u201cinstances of grossly misogynist narratives:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p>We note that these problems are wide reaching and that aspiring Members of Parliament from at least 3 political parties have come under scrutiny, underscoring the need for urgent and collective attention to end violence against women in politics.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Their position was <a href=\"https://newsday.co.tt/2020/07/29/shaming-on-campaign-trail/\">echoed</a> by Gabrielle Hosein, a lecturer at the Institute for Gender and Development Studies at The University of the West Indies (UWI), who noted that struggles over democracy are \u201calways interwoven\u201d with those of gender and sexuality, and condemned such \u201ccontinued tolerance for gender-based and sexual violence, which are not yet considered so abhorrent that they deny men political legitimacy\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If nothing else, understand young women\u2019s fear that these could be the men who hold power over them and to whom they must pay respect, like those abusive uncles who somehow retain their place and authority in the family.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As such, Womantra has called for amendments to Trinidad and Tobago's <a href=\"http://www.ttparliament.org/documents/1048.pdf\">constitution</a> so that \u201cpersons who are convicted of any offence involving sexual harassment or assault be disqualified from being elected or appointed as a member of the Senate and/or the House of Representatives.\u201d</p>\n<p>Language emerged as another key issue, with a request that the booklet on parliamentary language is updated \u201cto admonish the use of sexist statements, comments or words:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p>Borrowing from the <a href=\"https://search.coe.int/congress/pages/result_details.aspx?objectid=09000016809c8b7b&amp;fbclid=IwAR25-YituZOpSkWKpKXZX1HZaPLx_1R9tQp8d3t_QJto2qKeoq54g7WKrwY\">2020 Council of Europe (COE) report</a>, we echo the call for our Parliamentarians to take a strong stand against sexist attacks targeting women and to introduce or revise codes of conduct explicitly prohibiting sexist behaviour and speech in their assemblies. The COE Report\u00a0also recommends that States be vigilant during election periods with regard to sexist attacks against women and to monitor candidate nomination procedures for inequalities.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Womantra also saw the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service (TTPS) playing a critical role by taking \u201call allegations made against political officials or aspiring representatives seriously and commence investigations promptly, particularly given the impending election of August 10.\u201d</p>\n<p>Special mention was made of revenge porn, the investigation of which falls under the TPPS\u2019 <a href=\"https://newsday.co.tt/2018/03/21/cybercrime-unit-id-theft-catfishing-in-tt/\">Cybercrime Unit</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We stand in solidarity with women candidates who have been the victims of such attacks and firmly denounce the claims that victims of revenge porn should be barred from public office. Such a position is difficult to reconcile with the recent amendments to the Domestic Violence Act, which expand the definition of emotional or psychological abuse to include unwelcome or intimidatory contact through electronic means.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Citing the case of young political candidate Nabila Greene, who\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.looptt.com/content/unc-candidate-money-video-its-not-me\">allegedly</a>\u00a0appeared in a video in which a faceless man showered her with money, Hosein <a href=\"https://newsday.co.tt/2020/07/29/shaming-on-campaign-trail/\">observed</a> that \u201cgender and sexuality often become weaponised in electoral campaigns.\u201d Although a 29-year-old man has <a href=\"https://www.stabroeknews.com/2020/07/29/news/regional/trinidad/trinidad-man-charged-with-tryign-to-extort-80k-from-unc-candidate/\">since been charged</a> with harassment and attempted extortion of Greene, Hosein maintained that \u201cit\u2019s actually irrelevant what women [\u2026] do in private, legal and consensual entanglements\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Undermining women\u2019s aspirations for political leadership, through breaking their trust and violating their privacy, is a deliberate containment of their democratic participation. And, it works. It\u2019s one disturbing reason why there are fewer women in political leadership today.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For Womantra, it came down to scrutiny:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Perpetrators in positions of power not only silence victims but are granted access to further perpetuate their power and control over those they are charged with protecting. If violence against women is allowed to run rampant at the House of Representatives, how can gender equality be achieved in the lower rungs of the public service, the corporate sector, and within the home? We cannot and must not allow persons who commit crimes and devalue women, in words or in deeds, to have access to the seat of power in this country. Violence against women cannot be business as usual [\u2026]</p></blockquote>\n<p>Eight other civil society organisations have endorsed the statement, including <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/conflictwomenltd/posts/1390416701164681\">Conflict Women</a>, which financially empowers survivors of domestic and sexual abuse, and the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/caribbeanmaleactionnetwork/?eid=ARDY-e6oWDJS_LUTvtJbsL6rG6NGsCRHQY8YX-VfU_bZdA57-MWWngP0HvJsWrLmhWBWNKQtkd2zfEd6\">Caribbean Male Action Network</a>, which includes men and boys in the fight towards gender equality.</p>\n</div>",

        "content": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><em>[This article was written by an invited author, Andry R. Razafimbahoaka. The article was then edited by\u00a0Global Voices for context and clarification]</em></p>\n<p>Since the <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/crc.aspx\">Convention on the Rights of the Child</a> was signed in 1991, Madagascar has been multiplying its efforts to implement policies that protect child rights and created more than<a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/madagascar/fr/protection.html\"> 750 child protection networks</a> within the country since 2004. Despite this progress, abuse, violence, sexual exploitation and forced labor are still a tragic reality which silently occurs behind closed doors. According to a report released by the Malagasy State and UNICEF, every second young Malagasy claims to have been the victim of violence at school, and nine kids out of ten have been beaten by their family.</p>\n<h3>An alarming report by UNICEF</h3>\n<p>Following a request by the Malagasy government, UNICEF carried out a <a href=\"https://weshare.unicef.org/Detail/2AMZIFV23XY5\">study on violence perpetrated against children</a> in the country. The result of the study is beyond\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20180619-madagascar-violences-envers-enfants-font-parties-vie-quotidienne-chatiments\">alarming</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>89% des enfants disent qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 violent\u00e9s physiquement un jour au sein de leur foyer. Et pourtant ils sont 72% \u00e0 dire qu\u2019ils se sentent en s\u00e9curit\u00e9 chez eux.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"translation\"><p>89% of children report having suffered from physical domestic abuse at least once. Nonetheless, 72% of them say they feel safe at home.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Globally, the report highlights that violence is very often rooted in traditional practices which are very difficult to challenge. Rajae Sbihi, a\u00a0<span lang=\"en\">child psychiatrist</span> who partook to the study, <a href=\"http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20180619-madagascar-violences-envers-enfants-font-parties-vie-quotidienne-chatiments\">explains: </a></p>\n<blockquote><p>La violence est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une m\u00e9thode \u00e9ducative, que ce soit dans le milieu familial ou \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"translation\"><p>Violence is considered as a means of education, whether it is at home or at school.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>According to Sbihi, children in rural communities are even more at risk to violence, explaining that almost 20% of Malagasy children are not registered at birth \u2013 particularly in remote districts \u2013 which increases their vulnerability. Public powers are indeed often one of the only safeguards for child victims of violence, even more, if it happens at home. This type of violence leads to severe wounds, trauma, physical and emotional development troubles, risky behaviors or even dropping out of school altogether.</p>\n<h3>Different types of violence</h3>\n<p>Besides physical violence, there is a range of scenarios which hinders children development. In fact, 40% of young Malagasy's report having worked before the age of 18. Laureate Rasolofoniainarison, national administrator of projects at the office of the OIT <em>(in English ILO: International Labour Organization)</em> in\u00a0Antananarivo, explains how this\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.temoignages.re/international/monde/faire-travailler-leurs-enfants-les-rend-pauvres,93353\">perpetuates the cycle of poverty</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>les parents disent souvent qu\u2019ils les envoient travailler au lieu d\u2019aller \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole parce qu\u2019ils sont pauvres. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9 c\u2019est le fait de faire travailler leurs enfants qui les rend pauvres, en perp\u00e9tuant un cycle dans lequel l\u2019\u00e9ducation et la possibilit\u00e9 de s\u2019\u00e9lever socialement n\u2019ont aucune place.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"translation\"><p>Parents often say that they send them to work instead of going to school because they are poor. In reality, making their children work is what makes them poor, by perpetuating a cycle in which education and the possibility of rising socially have no place.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Young girls are even more vulnerable to this violence. Early marriage is part of the Malagasy tradition and is a problem for minors. More than one-third of girls between the ages of 15 and 19-years-old are already married or in a relationship. Very few teenagers use contraceptive methods (less than 8%) which considerably increases the number of unwanted pregnancies. In fact, <a href=\"http://geopolis.francetvinfo.fr/madagascar-mariees-meres-et-mineures-160297\">30% of the minors in the island have a child</a>, as reported by a rating from the World Atlas 2015. This number reaches up to <a href=\"http://geopolis.francetvinfo.fr/madagascar-mariees-meres-et-mineures-160297\">50% in some areas</a> of the capital. Another alarming statistic is the <a href=\"http://www.linfo.re/ocean-indien/madagascar/687972-exploitation-sexuelle-des-enfants-un-phenomene-inquietant-a-madagascar\">rising</a> rate of <a href=\"http://www.univ-antananarivo.mg/IMG/pdf/rakotomamonjy_marinah_master2.pdf\">sexual exploitation of girls for commercial purposes,</a> particularly <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/.../A_HRC_25_48_Add.2_SPA.doc\">near petroleum and mining sites</a>.</p>\n<h3>A new tool to better fight violence</h3>\n<p>Before this report, children's needs and rights were unknown in Madagascar. This latest report is seen as a tool which allows child protection advocates to better understand, prevent and respond to these risky situations. It is also a first step towards a more comprehensive national policy which aims to reduce violence. It can also be used as an argumentative tool to convince people to let go of traditional practices which can be detrimental to children. In total, UNICEF has deployed 240 social volunteers on the island to provide psycho-social support, communal dialogue and social mobilisation.</p>\n<p>UNICEF has also established partnerships in order to develop a code of conduct for all mining employees and sub-contractors in Madagascar, in an effort to end young women's sexual exploitation. This practical approach should hopefully have a progressive impact on their protection in the next few years.</p>\n</div>",

There are definitely more than just two approaches to help fix the police force in the Philippines. Clear and comprehensive training for police officers would be the obvious first step, followed by a ongoing program that monitors any violations as they occur. Also it would be wise to being hiring officers from a varied sample of the population, this way we have more representation and can help prevent problems before they happen. I think implementing these are a good step forward to cleaning up the police and still having a strong force going forward.",

        "content": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>On Valentine\u2019s Day 2021, three Ukrainian soldiers <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/ukrainian-soldiers-three-killed-blast-novoluhanske-east/31102554.html\">died</a> from an exploding landmine in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donbass#:~:text=A%20Euroregion%20of%20the%20same,and%20the%20Don%20Cossack%20Host.\">Donbas</a>, the region of eastern Ukraine split by fighting between the Ukrainian government and Russian-backed rebel forces. The youngest was born in 1994, three years after Ukraine became an independent state following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The year he was born, Ukraine agreed to get rid of all the nuclear weapons on its soil. When he was three, Russia and Ukraine signed a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian%E2%80%93Ukrainian_Friendship_Treaty\">Friendship Treaty</a>, affirming respect for each other\u2019s territorial integrity. Indeed, he grew up in a state whose territory was not plagued by armed disputes over unresolved legacies from Soviet and pre-Soviet times. Moldova and Georgia were not so lucky. Ukraine was a relative success story.</p>\n<p>This changed in early 2014 when protesters forced the resignation and flight of President <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Yanukovych\">Viktor Yanukovych</a>, a former Donbas political boss and pro-Russian politician. The Kremlin saw the so-called <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/specialcoverage/2013-special-coverage/ukraines-euromaiden-protests/\">Euromaidan protests</a>\u2014what participants in Ukraine called a \u201cRevolution of Dignity\u201d\u2014as a cynical western plot against its influence in Ukraine. Russia's leadership responded by fomenting revolts in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, and then intervening militarily to annex Crimea to Russia and support two breakaway territories in the Donbas, the self-proclaimed People's Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk (DNR/LNR).</p>\n<p>Negotiators from Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France eventually hammered out a series of protocols in Minsk designed to end the fighting, delimit a frontline between combatants, and transition the breakaway regions back to eventual Ukrainian government control. That was six years ago. The fighting has stabilized along a line of control but none of the Minsk II protocols have been implemented. However, stabilization is a relative term. Soldiers continue to die from sporadic incidents along what is now one of the most heavily mined military front lines in the world.</p>\n<p>To gauge opinions on both sides of the line of control, we conducted simultaneous <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/computer-assisted-telephone-interview\">computer-assisted telephone interviews</a> (CATI) in September and October 2020. These surveys with similar texts were fielded by two highly reputable companies: the LMR (Levada Marketing Research)\u00a0for the self-proclaimed DNR/LNR and the <a href=\"https://www.kiis.com.ua/?lang=eng\">Kyiv Institute of Sociology</a> (KIIS) in the government-controlled Donbas. While conditions in the DNR/LNR prohibit safe and reliable face-to-face survey research at this time, we contend that it remains important to try to capture the views of those directly affected by the war.</p>\n<p>Every aspect of daily life in and near a war zone is affected by the war. According to a 2020 Crisis Group <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/eastern-europe/ukraine/261-peace-ukraine-iii-costs-war-donbas\">report</a>, war has \u201cplunged an economically troubled region into ruin (\u2026) On both sides of the front line, residents have settled into a new normal that drifts between dreary and dire.\u201d Still, the daily routines endure despite the shadow of war. It is in everyday life\u2014people\u2019s ability to put food on the table, to hold a steady job, to see their children grow up safely, to obtain pensions\u2014that trust in a state and its institutions is built or lost. These comparative trust levels on both sides of the line of contact might well decide the future of this divided region.</p>\n<p>In this article, our results compare the trust in the national government in the Kyiv-controlled Donbas, on the one hand, and trust in the local authorities in the self-proclaimed DNR/LNR, on the other.\u00a0In the government-controlled parts of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, some local authorities have\u00a0not been able to carry out\u00a0their civic\u00a0responsibilities, while others have been replaced with a temporary civil-military administration. Local elections in Donbas have been severely curtailed since the start of the conflict, with the latest round in October 2020 <a href=\"https://rm.coe.int/information-report-on-the-elections-in-ukraine-25-october-2020-remote-/1680a07d8b\">cancelled</a> in many areas along the frontline, disenfranchising over 450,000 citizens.\u00a0The survey results confirm how distant the Kyiv government appears to the residents in this part of the Donbas. As seen in the first graphic (Figure 1), fewer than 10 per cent of the respondents trust the national government to take care of their needs as citizens, while about 45 per cent recorded their distrust.</p>\n\n<p>In the DNR/LNR, trust appears to be higher with 26 per cent of the respondents expressing trust in the local authorities (18 per cent distrust). But with nearly half neither trusting nor distrusting the local authorities, political support for the self-proclaimed DNR/LNR authorities appears lukewarm. Indeed, the results suggest that the local population, just like residents in the Kyiv-controlled Donbas, know that they have to manage their lives as best they can without holding out much hope for help from the authorities.</p>\n<p>Trust in the very institutions that should be responsive to citizen needs is low in the Donbas as a whole. But the relative gap in trust between the two parts of the Donbas is indicative of how residents in government-controlled regions believe Kyiv has left them behind. The Ukrainian state has significant work to do in those areas of the Donbas it governs.</p>\n<p>Another stark indication of this gap across the line of contact are the answers to the question: \u201cDo you think the region [country] is heading in the right or wrong direction?\u201d (Figure 2). A majority of respondents (59 per cent) in the government-controlled Donbas think that things are heading in the wrong direction. In contrast, in the DNR/LNR, a plurality of respondents (44 per cent) think that things are heading in the right direction (23 per cent in the wrong direction), though about a third remain uncertain.</p>\n\n<p>One of the characteristics of the Donbas conflict, in contrast to the conflicts in Moldova and Georgia, is that it erupted more than two decades after the collapse of the Soviet Union. While there was some tension over the fate of the Donbas after Ukrainian independence, it was not a burning issue for most residents. In fact, self-determination for the region was a cause that motivated only a minority. The ouster of the pro-Russian Yanukovych government in Kyiv in early 2014 nurtured and fed that sentiment. It is worth probing just how strongly people feel loyalty to the state and flag (DNR/LNR or Ukrainian) under which they currently live.</p>\n<p>In our survey, we asked a question designed to measure what academics term a pure \u201cpublic goods\u201d vision of the state. It asks respondents to agree or disagree with the following statement: \u201cIt does not matter what country I live in; all I want is a good job and a good pension.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>This graph (Figure 3) might surprise readers, showing that majorities on both sides of the line of contact agree with the statement. Economic and material security thus trumps separatism and nationalism. Importantly, the numbers who disagree (just over one-third of the population) are also nearly identical on both sides of the Donbas dividing line.\u00a0While this is a minority sentiment among ordinary people, those affirming the greater importance of \u201ccountry\u201d express the dominant and often the only acceptable view of those in positions of power. Whose flag flies where is the overriding concern.</p>\n<p>Examination of the answers to these three questions by age and nationality reveals an important asymmetry. In the government-controlled area, older people and self-identified Russians are less trusting of the authorities and agree more strongly with the statement about material needs being more important than the flag under which they live. In the self-proclaimed DNR/LNR, it is younger people and self-identified Ukrainians who express these sentiments more strongly.</p>\n<p>The degree of trust in local authorities on both sides of the territorial divide in the Donbas is a crucial factor shaping the future of the region. In certain fundamental ways, the aspirations of the majority of people on both sides are the same. However, this conflict was never about the Donbas alone: it is also about broader geopolitical struggles. As long as these endure, the conflict in the Donbas is likely to persist and lines on the ground and in residents\u2019 minds are likely to become more entrenched.</p>\n<p><i>The authors acknowledge funding for this work from a joint National Science Foundation/Research Council UK grant (NSF award #1759645; ESRC award #ES/S005919/1) and from ZOiS (Centre for East European and International Studies), Berlin.</i></p>\n</div>",

But in two more recent votes \u2014 to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UN_HRC/status/1498223682958856195?s=20&amp;t=NWVh9c2Kz1Eq3rLFefI6Uw\">suspend</a> Russia from the UN Human Rights Council and in <a href=\"https://hetq.am/en/article/141785\">condemning the invasion</a> of Ukraine at the UN General Assembly \u2014 Armenia abstained.</p>\n<p>According to Daniel Ioannisyan, a democracy watchdog based in Yerevan, the inconspicuous shift in Armenia\u2019s position in these two cases may be seen as \u201cmajor progress,\u201d but \u201conly in the context of Amenia\u2019s dependence on Russia.\u201d He continued, \u201cArmenia is in such a sad situation regarding its sovereignty and independence from Russia that this silence is already a good thing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ioannisyan is referring to Armenia\u2019s political dependence on Russia, which includes its membership in the Russian-led <a href=\"https://en.odkb-csto.org/\">Eurasian Economic Union and Collective Security Treaty Organization</a>, the country\u2019s main economic and security partnerships. The two countries also have a <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/Russian_President_Medvedev_To_Visit_Armenia/2131915.html\">separate strategic partnership agreement</a> that regulates the presence of Russia's military base and troops in Armenia.</p>\n<p>This dependence on Russia grew stronger following the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War, which <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54882564\">ended</a> with Russian mediation and the deployment of over 2,000 Russian peacekeepers to the area. Thus, the Armenia-controlled parts of Nagorno-Karabakh appeared to be under de facto control of Russia. In addition, the number of Russian troops in Armenia reached roughly 10,000 with a permanent military base in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyumri\">Gyumri</a> and a military airport in Yerevan, as well as other minor strategic positions. Russian troops are also in control of the <a href=\"https://tass.com/world/1014872?utm_source=google.com&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=google.com&amp;utm_referrer=google.com\">Armenia-Turkey border</a>.</p>\n<p>\u201c[Armenia has] struggled to maintain a strategic \u2018balance\u2019 between its security partnership with Russia and its interest in deepening ties with the EU and the West over the past twenty years,\u201d <a href=\"https://regional-studies.org/about/staff/richard-giragosian\">Richard Giragosian</a>, director of the <a href=\"https://regional-studies.org\">Regional Studies Center</a>, a Yerevan-based think tank, told OC Media.</p>\n<p>However, Giragosian thinks that Russia will likely start demanding greater support and more open loyalty, in which case, \u201cany sense of diplomatic balance may be lost, threatening to push Armenia into a vulnerable and isolated position on the wrong side of history.\u201d He further explained, \u201cAlthough Armenia\u2019s position, as the only other country besides Russia to oppose that move [silence on sanctions], dangerously isolates it, there was little choice and even less of an alternative.\u201d</p>\n<p>Considering Armenia\u2019s middling position between support and condemnation of Moscow\u2019s actions, there\u2019s a fear that the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60125659\">sanctions set for Russia</a> may fall on (or at least influence) Armenia too \u2014 although Ioannsiyan thinks Armenia will be affected not by the sanctions themselves, but rather, by Russia\u2019s expected attempts to use Armenia and other countries to bypass them.</p>\n<p>\u201cIn this case,\u201d he surmised, \u201cthere may be bad consequences for Armenia.\u201d In a hypothesised scenario where Russia emerged the victor in the war, Ioannsiyan warned that Armenia may be forced into the process of forming the \u201cSoviet Union 2.0.\u201d</p>\n<h3>People, weapons, and propaganda</h3>\n<p>The response of the Armenian people has not differed much from that of its government. Journalist and pro-peace activist Aram Amirbekyan suggested that the reactions among Armenians were \u201clogical\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u201cUnfortunately, many were even happy with what was happening,\u201d Amirbekyan said, explaining that people were justifying their apathy because of Ukraine\u2019s support of Azerbaijan during the 2020 war. \u201cI can\u2019t share this kind of response,\u201d he continued, \u201cas [Russia\u2019s invasion] is aggression that should be condemned \u2014 but the \u2018enemy-ally\u2019 propaganda was so strong in Armenia that a reality was created where people support Russia. Ukraine, in this context, was perceived as an enemy that sells weapons and white phosphorous to Azerbaijan, but so did Russia. Everyone sells weapons to everyone.\u201d</p>\n<p>One allegation surrounding Ukrainian support to Azerbaijan was that Kyiv provided Baku with <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20201119-nagorno-karabakh-ceasefire-armenia-accuses-azerbaijan-of-using-phosphorus-bombs\">white phosphorous</a> that was used by Azerbaijan during the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War. Film director Sarik Andreasyan, a former friend of Ukrainian President Volodymyr\u00a0Zelenskiy, was one of many to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HovhanNaz/status/1497339796326342658?s=20&amp;t=iLyjN7L0tZEfI9_alYAF5A\">perpetuate</a> such accusations, which Zelenskiy has categorically <a href=\"https://www.promoteukraine.org/president-zelensky-information-on-supply-of-phosphorus-bombs-to-ukraine-to-russia-%E2%80%92-russian-fake/\">denied</a>.</p>\n<p>According to\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.sipri.org/commentary/topical-backgrounder/2021/arms-transfers-conflict-zones-case-nagorno-karabakh#:~:text=Russia's%20supplies%20to%20Azerbaijan%20included,2020%20war%20over%20Nagorno%2DKarabakh.\">the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute</a>, Russia provided over 60 percent of Azerbaijan\u2019s weapons between 2011 and 2020, while Ukraine only sold over 1 percent during the same time (although before 2010, that number was significantly higher).</p>\n<p>Citing a survey by the <a href=\"https://uic.am/en/\">Union of Informed Citizens</a>, Ioannsyan posited that Russian propaganda has also played a significant role in the formation of Armenian public opinion, with over 11 percent of Armenians considering Russian state media outlets trustworthy sources of information. \u201cThis, among other things, influences public opinion, and unfortunately, its support of Putin\u2019s actions. And Armenia should work intensively against disinformation campaigns,\u201d he added.</p>\n<p>Coming on the heels of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, one such \u201ccampaign\u201d was the staged draping of a 50-meter banner across one of Yerevan\u2019s largest bridges, the Kyivian, which read, \u201cRussian army.\u201d Though instantly going viral with hundreds of thousands of views, local journalists established that the sign was only hung for nine minutes in order to be filmed before being\u00a0<a href=\"https://media.am/hy/verified/2022/02/27/31847/\">taken down</a>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43948181\">2018 revolution</a> and the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War have also changed perceptions in Armenia, Amirbekyan believes. Such recent events made Armenians more \u201cpoliticized,\u201d he says, \u201cand [\u2026] the events in Ukraine are perceived as part of these geopolitical perceptions.\u201d This is also why Amirbekyan called Armenia\u2019s response \u201clogical\u201d: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to expect from Armenia [\u2026] explicit support for Ukraine, as Russian troops are in Karabakh as the direct guarantor of the security of the people there.\u201d</p>\n<p>While he says he would like to \u201csee Armenia in such a geopolitical situation to be able to directly condemn this aggression and colonial-imperial policy,\u201d Amirbekyan says he is \u201chappy that it was able to keep some sort of neutrality.\u201d He also noted, \u201cAt the same time, [\u2026] we should notice that there\u2019s compassion in Armenia towards the people in Ukraine. After all, there are many Armenians in Ukraine; relations between the countries and people were quite warm. The sight of Kyiv or Lviv shelled is painful for Armenians too.\u201d</p>\n<h3>Ready to receive refugees</h3>\n<p>According to estimates, there are <a href=\"https://www.asbarez.com/many-armenians-want-to-leave-ukraine/\">almost 400,000</a> Armenians and people with Armenian roots in Ukraine. Officially, Armenians in Ukraine number around 130,000. Russia, on the other hand, has the largest Armenian population \u2014 <a href=\"https://russia.mfa.am/en/community-overview/\">1.2 million</a>.</p>\n<p>Both Armenia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.mfa.am/en/\">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> and the head of the Armenian community of Ukraine, Norik Grigorian, have said there is no exact <a href=\"https://www.azatutyun.am/a/31728579.html#:~:text=The%20ministry%20announced%20on%20Saturday%20that%20Armenian%20nationals%20do%20not%20need%20Schengen%20visas%20to%20enter%20Ukraine%E2%80%99s%20European%20Union%20neighbors%3A%20Poland%2C%20Slovakia%2C%20Hungary%20and%20Romania.%20It%20also%20said%20Armenia%20is%20ready%20to%20receive%20them%20and%20is%20now%20exploring%20%E2%80%9Cother%20options%20for%20evacuating%20them.%E2%80%9D\">information</a>\u00a0on how many of these Armenians living outside the country have fled the war, or how many have re-entered Armenia. However, the ministry has <a href=\"https://www.mfa.am/en/press-releases/2022/02/26/information/11315\">expressed a willingness</a> to not only receive ethnic Armenians and Armenian citizens, but also to accept foreign refugees.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Economy has <a href=\"http://arka.am/en/news/economy/armenia_s_ministry_of_economy_sets_up_working_group_to_help_foreign_companies_relocate_their_busines/\">established a group</a> to help Armenians, Russians, Belarusians, and Ukrainians intending to move to Armenia. This includes a simplified procedure for relocating companies registered in those countries to Armenia. Minister <a href=\"https://www.mineconomy.am/en/employee/55\">Vahan Kerobyan</a> confirmed that about a dozen Russian companies have already <a href=\"https://www.azatutyun.am/a/31730405.html\">relocated</a> to Armenia. He said that the government was trying to make the country a \u201cpleasant environment\u201d for foreigners who may decide to move, part of which entailed the provision of an appropriate business environment.</p>\n</div>",

In the 2023 Freedom in the World Index, the country ranked in the <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/2023-03/FIW_2023_50Years_DigitalPDF.pdf\">bottom</a> three, behind only war-torn Syria and ahead of North Korea. The issue of internet censorship is particularly acute in Turkmenistan. In 2016, the media freedom organization Reporters without Borders listed the country as one of the <a href=\"https://acca.media/en/14040/turkmenistan-the-authorities-almost-completely-blocked-the-internet-in-the-country/\">enemies of the internet</a> due to its heavy censorship and information control policies. The internet speed in Turkmenistan is the <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/turkmenistan-internet-slowest-restrictions/31652467.html\">slowest in the world</a>. The authorities <a href=\"https://acca.media/en/5777/turkmenistan-dozens-of-people-arrested-for-installing-vpn-apps/\">arrest citizens</a> who use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network\">VPN</a> apps to access censored content.</p>\n\n<p>Between 2021 and 2022<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">,</span> a team of computer scientists conducted the first and only large-scale research on internet censorship in Turkmenistan, in which they tested 15.5 million domains for censorship and found out that over 122,000 domains are blocked. Full research results are available <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.04835.pdf\">here</a>. Global Voices spoke to Nguyen Phong from the research team to learn about what content is censored, how it is done, and what methods can be employed to circumvent censorship. Currently, Phong is a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Chicago. The interview has been edited for clarity.</p>\n<div class=\"factbox\">\n<h4>For more, read: <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2023/03/24/like-father-like-son-turkmenistans-new-president-carries-on-his-predecessors-repressive-policies/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Like father, like son: Turkmenistan\u2019s new president carries on his predecessor\u2019s repressive policies\">Like father, like son: Turkmenistan\u2019s new president carries on his predecessor\u2019s repressive policies</a></h4>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Nurbek Bekmurzaev (NB): \u00a0Can you tell about your research: who conducted it, when did they do it and why?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Nguyen Phong (NP):</strong> It was conducted by a team of computer scientists from the University of Chicago and University of Maryland.\u00a0 In the first part of the research paper, we discuss the blocking mechanism of the firewalls used in Turkmenistan. Based on their filtering behaviors, we designed a system to explore what is being blocked. Based on this understanding we then came up with techniques to bypass internet censorship in Turkmenistan.</p>\n<p>The research started at the end of 2021 and took over one year. We read about the internet censorship in Turkmenistan and realized that no one has done any work on it at a systemic level and on a large scale. For computer scientists, these are fascinating questions to answer because I want to know how the Turkmenistan government is making use of firewalls and interference techniques to block access to the Internet.</p>\n<p>Most people studying censorship in a particular country ask someone there to help run tests. In Turkmenistan it's difficult to use this method. It can be risky because your traffic, your internet connection, and those testing measurements\u00a0 will stick out from the rest of the allowed traffic. That is what motivated us to conduct this study. We asked ourselves whether we can measure censorship in this country without relying on local people.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>NB: What makes your research different from previous research on internet censorship in Turkmenistan?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>NP:</strong> First, we don't rely on any local volunteers or any people who have a machine in the country. These prior approaches may work well but they\u00a0won't scale. Some of them are one-off measurements while censorship can change every day.</p>\n<p>The second difference is the scale of the research. We tested 15.5 million unique domains. Previous work has tested a maximum of a couple of thousand popular domains. We found out that over 122,000 domains are censored.</p>\n<p>We conducted the empirical part of the research in September 2022. However, the system is still running and collecting data. If the firewalls behave the same way, we will have more data about what is being censored and whether we see any change over time.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>NB: What were the challenges of conducting this research? How did you address them?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>NP:\u00a0</strong> Initially, we wanted to rent a server in Turkmenistan, but we couldn't find any. If you want to rent a virtual server there, you have to go through the government, which controls everything. So we stopped the research for a while since we couldn\u2019t rent a server there.</p>\n<p>But then we learned that the censorship can actually be triggered from outside. You don't have to be inside the country to trigger it, you just have to come up with a sequence of network packets to trick the firewall to believe that you are communicating with an actual machine on the other side of the firewall, so it will take blocking actions. We named our system TMC, which simply stands for Turkmenistan censorship.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>NB: What are your main findings? How does the government censor the internet? What is the scale of censorship?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>NP:</strong> I previously studied internet censorship in China, where the government blocks more than 300,000 domains. I am thus interested in investigating if Turkmenistan was engaged in the same kind of censorship on a similar scale. At the beginning I thought that Turkmenistan did not have the technology for it. Then I conducted this study and found out I was completely wrong.</p>\n<p>The authorities block way more than people may have thought before. We found out that they have many block lists. They block at different layers, different protocols: DNS, HTTP, HTTPS. They block domains via what we call regular expressions, which is a rule based blocking system. For example, every domain name with the word \u201cporn\u201d is blocked in Turkmenistan. Even if it's not a pornography website, if it has the word porn in its name, it will be automatically blocked.</p>\n<p>Because of this blocking system, there is a lot of collateral damage. There are a bunch of unrelated websites that are blocked. One of the worst blocking rules in Turkmenistan is that the government blocks every website that ends with w.org, which is WordPress. It is used by activists and bloggers, which is why they do it.</p>\n<p>You can take a look at Figures 4, 5, and 6 in the paper to learn more about it. There is a lot of adult content that is being blocked. It is not just pornography, it is also LGBTQ+ and gender identity education content. Similarly to the Great Firewall of China, news, business and social media websites are blocked.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>NB: Let's move on to the second part of your research, which is about circumventing censorship. How can people that live in Turkmenistan circumvent the censorship and access blocked content?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>NP:</strong> As a circumvention tool, we propose dividing a sequence of network packets. When you want to go to twitter.com, your request is blocked. But if you divide it into \u2018twi\u2019 and \u2018tter.come,\u2019\u00a0it does not recognize your request and lets you access the website. This works because of how the internet operates \u2014 the Twitter server is able to reassemble two packets into one.</p>\n<p>Another strategy to circumvent censorship is similar to having a conversation with the server and saying: \u201cI want to talk about twitter.com\u201d and then right after that saying: \u201cNever mind. I don't want to talk about it. Let's talk about something else.\u201d The firewall thinks: \u201cOh, the person already changed the topic, let's forget about it.\u201d But in fact you have already told the server that you actually want to talk about twitter.com. The part of the conversation where you say: \u201cHey, I don't want to talk about twitter.com,\u201d is pronounced quietly so the server does not hear it.</p>\n<p>We are communicating with a lot of researchers and developers who build and operate circumvention tools. We will share the results from this paper with these organizations to integrate our circumvention strategies into their tools, and eventually make them\u00a0 available to people in the country to use.</p></blockquote>\n</div>",

        "content": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>One might think that a Middle Eastern powerhouse like Iran has little connection to a conflict between two former Soviet republics in the South Caucasus that began before the communist bloc even broke up. That would be quite wrong, however.</p>\n<p>Tensions over the breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region that fell under Armenian control following a war with Azerbaijan which began in the late 1980s are never far from the surface in relations between the two countries.</p>\n<p>A March 29 <a href=\"https://eurasianet.org/first-formal-aliyev-pashinyan-meeting-deemed-a-success\">meeting</a> between Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev and Armenia's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaoloBottleneck/status/1115910761707188230\">Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan</a> was billed as among the most positive in recent years, but it was overshadowed almost immediately by the <a href=\"https://eurasianet.org/after-peace-negotiations-threats-of-war-break-out-between-armenia-and-azerbaijan\">aggressive rhetoric</a> of subordinate officials on both sides.</p>\n<p>In such a tense diplomatic atmosphere, powerful geopolitical neighbours have an important role to play. While the focus in this respect is often on <a href=\"https://mycountryeurope.com/international-relations/only-russia-can-solve-the-nagorno-karabakh-conflict/\">traditional ex-Soviet power-broker Russia</a>, Iran is also uniquely positioned to impact the conflict for better or worse.</p>\n<h3>Diasporas speak</h3>\n<p>Present-day Azerbaijan's borders are a product of the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17043424\">Turkmanchay Treaty</a>\u00a0between Tsarist Russia and the Persian Empire that divided the country along the Arax River in 1828.</p>\n<p>According to this treaty, Azerbaijan became part of the Russian Empire while the lands to the south of the country became part of what is now known as Iran.</p>\n<p>As a result, the number of Azeris in Iran far outnumber those in the Republic of Azerbaijan that has a population of 10 million people. Presently there is no official data available on the number of this country\u2019s Azeri population. But the <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Encyclopedia_of_the_Stateless_Nations_A.html?id=OLKKVXgEpkoC&amp;redir_esc=y\">Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations (2002)</a> put the number of Azeris in Iran at 18,500,000 people, or over a quarter of Iran's population.</p>\n<p>In Azerbaijan, many criticise Iran for having friendly ties and cooperating with Armenia, while Tehran, in turn, is wary of Baku's economic and military partnership with Israel. Although close religious and cultural ties bind Iranians and Azeris \u2014 they mostly share Shia Islam as a faith \u2014 Azerbaijan's government is strongly secular and suspicious of Iran's potential influence over conservatives in the Caucasus country.</p>\n<p>Inside Iran,\u00a0millions of Azeris are not allowed to receive education in their own language. This fact is in notable contrast to the position of diaspora Armenians in Iran, who according to various sources number between\u00a0<a href=\"https://eurasianet.org/armenia-iranian-armenians-struggle-to-change-image-as-foreigners\">70,000</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/276961-christian-armenia-and-islamic-iran-an-unusual-partnership-explained\">150,000</a>\u00a0and are able to receive Armenian-language schooling there.</p>\n<p>As if these long-standing bones of contention were not enough, tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh are also mirrored in discourse between the two communities.</p>\n<p>Anger over the disputed territory was on full display during Pashinyan's visit to Tehran at the end of February that culminated in a\u00a0number of protests, mainly by fans of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractor_Sazi_F.C.\">Tractor Sazi Tabriz\u00a0 FC</a>, a football club based in the Azeri-populated northern Iranian city of Tabriz that has become a hub for Azeri activism in recent years.</p>\n<p>The protesters were particularly unhappy that Pashinyan had chosen to visit Iran on February 27, immediately after the anniversary of one of the bloodiest chapters in the six-year Karabakh war, known to Azeris as the Khojaly massacre of February 26, 1992.</p>\n<p>Many Azeris perceived Pashinyan's visit as a betrayal. Compounding this discontent was the fact that a <a href=\"https://news.am/eng/news/498726.html\">poster</a> that read \u201cKarabakh is Armenia. Period\u201d was raised during Pashinyan's meeting with Armenian diaspora representatives.</p>\n\n<p>A total of twenty-eight supporters of Tractor Sazi\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gunaz.tv/az/xeberler/insan-haqlari-2/29-guneyli-feal-qarabagla-bagli-plakata-etiraz-etdiyi-ucun-saxlanilib-114031\">were detained</a>\u00a0by Iranian police March 1, whilst leaving Sahand stadium following the Tractor-Sepahan game on that day.</p>\n<p>The arrests followed some 50,000 fans chanting the slogan <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/y3y3fhxa\">\u201cKarabakh is ours and will remain so</a>\u201d in the stadium where the Armenian flag was set alight.</p>\n<p>On March 3, protesters in Azerbaijan's capital Baku picketed the Iranian embassy in a show of support with their Southern bretheren. Iran's ambassador in the country\u00a0Mahmoud Vaze\u2019i <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/y2vk7v6g\">insisted</a> that relations between Iran and Azerbaijan were solid and resilient in an apparent response to the picket.\u00a0Vaze\u2019i said Iran \u201cwill not let any interior or exterior forces damage our good ties with Azerbaijan.\u201d</p>\n<p>The scandal over Pashinyan's visit also reached Iran's legislature where an ethnic Azeri MP from Iran's Azeri-populated Urmia (Ormiyeh) region,<a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/yxvhrzrp\"> Ruhulla Hazratopour</a>, reiterated complaints over timing and called for Iran to clarify its position on Karabakh at a March 17 session.</p>\n<p>MP Hazratopour\u00a0<a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/yxvhrzrp\">said</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I am addressing the [Iranian] Foreign Affairs Ministry. What was the point of the Armenian Prime Minister\u2019s visit to Iran on the anniversary of the massacre of Muslims in Khojaly, which caused a number of problems? As the leader\u00a0has stated, and as the Azerbaijani people believe, Karabakh is the land of Islam. I am asking you now \u2013 what is the difference between Palestine and Karabakh? The Islamic Republic [of Iran] is an important Muslim country. We must play the role of a unifier in the region and protect all oppressed Muslims across the world.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The MP finished his speech with a poem in the Azeri language.</p>\n<h3><strong>Fanning the flames\u00a0</strong></h3>\n<p>Typically, opposition to the Pashinyan visit was amplified on Facebook. One Facebook page used by Iranian Azeri activists is Gunay Azerbaycan (Southern Azerbaijan), which has around 20,000 followers. On March 3 the page carried a photo from Pashinyan's meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani accompanied by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/575673516150766/videos/301468523873682/?epa=SEARCH_BOX\">graphic footage</a> from the Khojaly massacre, where women and children were among more than 600 killed by Armenian troops, according to Azerbaijani authorities.</p>\n<p>The same page also posted a doctored photo from the Armenian prime minister\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/575673516150766/photos/a.586996675018450/769980973386685/?type=3&amp;eid=ARBev-Mr4iPqdMELEXbNSGoJzhY2yeAljwOIE-wmPLUaGm6f45v1Q2POu166ldLc2NyM6HUx5QDfhmP-&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARDiOBX7pTXR9gX1RlB3R3P0FzSkwl7rmv3SRrIcIbp2vhO5-Q-zJtKQtHNeBj6IJv_sCj3j8nyv8A2pLvgBXlcuYPGu35-UfGD6vrup8QWxvkqQMqF_aPYg1P1CjLAQpPpNlP6Sb23g2tIRGb85evhxuZuTWxXii-Eaj-GnHF-tW_p79CW2pnfsP8VZ-0XlT7kAmApp_qQGJTht7Mz9lJf75jcZ3rNJXeKh3-MqT-PAXAYYPXsurR-SHYqC1itXBehthILq0g48c3njRqoElbHBb8kule6h6LUtzJhol8BRm3mqGkDuNs0TLrvavHx8kvtULHAPm9iYXxQJkoRKlLI&amp;__tn__=EHH-R\"> meeting</a>\u00a0that showed an illustrated corpse of a small child laying in front of the two officials \u2014 another reference to the victims of Khojaly massacre.</p>\n<p>Of the dozens of Iranian Azeris that liked and shared this image, many were seemingly not born at the time of the Khojaly incident. But as Baku and Yerevan inch gingerly towards the negotiating table on Karabakh, the era of social media has lent fresh life to the conflict.</p>\n</div>",

Morgan actually didn't expect the response to be as enthusiastic as it was; when he realised that 200+ people had registered, he contacted <a href=\"https://whoswhotnt.com/jonathan-barcant/\">Jonathan Barcant</a>, managing director of <a href=\"https://iamovement.org/\">IAMovement</a>, a nongovernmental organisation that advocates for environmental causes and has had experience hosting climate marches in the past. IAMovement was happy to lend its support, offer advice, take the lead on communications and help Morgan sort out logistics like legal permissions and police clearance.</p>\n\n<h3>#AmazonChallenge</h3>\n<p>For its part, IAMovement has been promoting the <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/amazonchallenge#/\">#AmazonChallenge</a>, an initiative undertaken in conjunction with like-minded global organisations such as <a href=\"http://youngwatersolutions.org/\">Young Water Solutions</a>, a nonprofit that empowers youth to contribute to universal water sanitation, hygiene and resources management.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvG7vmDetCY\">concept</a>\u00a0is that with seven billion people on the planet, if we all just planted one tree it would make a huge difference in offsetting the adverse effects of global heating. The #AmazonChallenge entails planting a tree that you can nurture (or paying to have one planted on your behalf), posting a photo or video of it and nominating three friends to do the same. The Indiegogo donation page <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/amazonchallenge#/\">notes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We are not only helping to undo some of the damages in the Amazon and to capture carbon through our most efficient carbon capture machines right now (trees:), but we are also sending a collective message to those in power that [\u2026] our planet, forests, and animals do mean a lot to us, and we believe their PROTECTION and REGENERATION should be a global priority.</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Barcant, the project has thus far had plantings in Trinidad and Tobago, Ireland, Belgium, the United Kingdom, South Africa and Sri Lanka. \u201cWhat's really cool about the #AmazonChallenge\u201d, he says, \u201cis that for every one tree you plant, you can have the impact of four trees being planted because it's you plus the three other people you nominate.\u201d</p>\n\n<h3>Heart for Amazon</h3>\n<p>The whole thrust is being supported by <a href=\"https://www.globalshapers.org/story\">Global Shapers</a>, the youth arm of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum#Global_Shapers\">World Economic Forum</a>\u00a0\u2014 one of the many partners for the <a href=\"https://newsday.co.tt/2019/09/29/trinis-plant-trees-in-solidarity-with-the-amazon/\">Heart For Amazon event</a>, which took place on September 28, 2019, in <a href=\"http://nationaltrust.tt/location/the-hollows/\">The Hollows</a> of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Park_Savannah\">Queen's Park Savannah</a>, the city of Port of Spain's main green space.</p>\n<p>A range of environmentally conscious local organisations came together and pooled their efforts to stage the event, including IAMovement, <a href=\"https://hellogreentt.com/home\">Hello Green</a>, <a href=\"https://www.oneyogatt.com/\">One Yoga</a>, <a href=\"http://www.newfireworld.com/\">New Fire Festival</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/grundloskollektiv/photos/a.1884651408212243/2849327791744595/?type=3&amp;theater\">Grundlos Kollektiv</a>. Participants received trees to plant in the #AmazonChallenge and nominated friends to do the same; all Global Shapers representatives also each chose three \u201cShapers\u201d in other Caribbean hubs to follow suit, sparking the involvement of other islands and scaling up the tree planting initiative.</p>\n<p>But for Caribbean climate change activists, it doesn't stop there. Small Island Developing States are among the <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2019/09/18/why-the-bahamas-needs-kindness-right-now/\">most vulnerable</a> when it comes to the disastrous effects of climate change, from rising sea levels and <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2019/09/15/tobagos-coral-bleaching-alert-makes-it-clear-there-is-no-alternative-to-fighting-the-climate-crisis/\">coral bleaching</a> to <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2019/09/15/jamaica-remembers-hurricane-gilbert-but-is-the-island-prepared-for-a-dorian/\">increasingly intense</a> <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2019/09/03/as-hurricane-dorian-devastates-the-bahamas-a-cry-for-the-caribbean-to-face-up-to-the-climate-crisis/\">storms</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, Barbados\u2019 prime minister, Mia Mottley, in addressing the United Nations Climate Event Summit in New York on September 23, 2019, <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/barbados-warns-mass-climate-migration_n_5d891b9ce4b0938b59329653?fbclid=IwAR17wmVvdpVu9-BxrbvlS_vwvQyMrSyQV4fqjldvbbcHmIIyvv6FWndTEM0\">told world leaders</a> to expect a mass migration of refugees if the climate crisis is not solved:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In other words, two degrees needs to be taken off the table once and for all. The global community must accept that it is within our power to halt and reverse climate change. [\u2026]</p>\n<p>We refuse to be relegated to the footnotes of history and to be collateral damage for the greed of others, for we have contributed less than one percent of greenhouse gas emissions.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Other regional leaders joined the <a href=\"https://gallery.mailchimp.com/bb7c8b2d02cf287e7132078a2/files/86015b31-8040-4213-b613-e12e082eab50/Prime_Minister_of_St._Kitts_and_Nevis_UNGA_Speech_September_27_2019.pdf\">clarion call</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Via WhatsApp, Kathryn Christopher, curator of the Global Shapers Port of Spain hub, explained to Global Voices: </p>\n<blockquote><p>All activism must be intersectional [\u2026] I echo the sentiments expressed by PM Mottley at the UN Climate Action Summit this past September, that the Caribbean is at the forefront of the effects of climate change.  The climate crisis is even more immediate and urgent for us and other SIDS. </p>\n<p>Initiatives like the Amazon Challenge and Saturday\u2019s Heart for Amazon event both educate and find a way to address this urgency, as well as empower individuals to act.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Preparing for COP 25</h3>\n<p>The next major step forward comes in December 2019 with an event called <a href=\"https://6dnow.org/eng.html\">6D</a>, pegged as \u201cthe largest-ever global chain of climate actions in history\u201d. IAMovement and Young Water Solutions are currently in discussions with 6D organisers and hopes to pair its #AmazonChallenge with the 6D movement to have greater impact and confront the climate emergency head-on. December 6 is when world leaders will meet to discuss the planet's environmental future during the <a href=\"https://sdg.iisd.org/events/unfccc-cop-25/\">COP 25</a>, the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties, which takes place in Santiago, Chile, from December 2-13, 2019.</p>\n<p>The idea around 6D is to communicate that the power is in all of our hands and everyone can make a difference: Individuals can plant trees, practice composting or do beach clean-ups; companies can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by investing in sustainable technologies; NGOs and communities can undertake reforestation projects, <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2019/02/26/a-digital-nomad-from-the-uk-advocates-for-solar-power-in-all-island-nations/\">install renewable energies</a>, and recycle; and governments can set and achieve the goals needed to ensure that the temperature will not pass the 1.5\u00b0C in relation to preindustrial levels.</p>\n<p>According to Kathryn Christopher: </p>\n<blockquote><p>One of the greatest hindrances to change is the thought that your one act is insignificant, and because of this, to decide to take no action at all.</p></blockquote>\n</div>",

One of the aims of the global strike was to mobilize young people and put pressure on world leaders who were scheduled to meet at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York.</p>\n<p>The protest actions in Southeast Asia highlighted various issues such as the impact of large-scale mining, haze pollution, and continuing dependence on fossil fuels. Like in other parts of the world, the climate strikes in Southeast Asia featured the active participation and leadership of young people.</p>\n<p>Below is an overview of protest activities across Southeast Asia:</p>\n<h4><strong>Myanmar protesters demand the declaration of a climate emergency</strong></h4>\n<p>More than 200 people <a href=\"http://www.mizzima.com/article/climate-strike-protesters-take-streets-myanmar\">marched</a> from the new Bogyoke Market to Sule Pagoda, and then gathered outside Mahabandoola Park in Yangon on 21 September. They urged the Myanmar government to declare a climate emergency, impose a moratorium on projects that harm the environment, and promote environmental justice.</p>\n\n<h4><strong>Filipino activists call for climate justice</strong></h4>\n<p>More than 600 young environmentalists in Manila participated in a human-Earth formation while carrying placards that call for climate justice on 20 September. They <a href=\"https://www.bulatlat.com/2019/09/22/filipino-youth-join-global-climate-strike/?fbclid=IwAR0DwPRFXzuJZiBDAUoo797iEMmxNcTuNvr5-JCLZ5_IRY52r5tQDPUKrnM\">denounced</a> the rising number of extrajudicial killings targeting environmental defenders and land rights activists under the government of President Rodrigo Duterte who came to power in 2016.</p>\n<h4><strong>Thailand asked to stop building coal plants</strong></h4>\n<p>More than 150 young environmentalists held a <a href=\"http://www.khaosodenglish.com/news/2019/09/20/100-youth-ditch-school-for-climate-strike/\">die-in</a> protest in front of Thailand\u2019s Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment on 20 September. They submitted a petition asking the government to phase out coal and transition to renewable energy. A government official received the letter and lauded the concern of young people for the environment.</p>\n\n<h4><strong>Malaysia pressed to act against haze pollution</strong></h4>\n<p>More than 300 people joined the protest <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2019/09/22/300-gather-against-haze-and-climate-change-inaction\">organized</a> by Klima Action Malaysia on 21 September. They linked the worsening haze pollution to the climate crisis and asked the government to probe companies responsible for financing the deforestation of lands in Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MYCLIMATESTRIKE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MYCLIMATESTRIKE</a> \u2013 Malaysians march in solidarity with the worldwide climate strike movement. <a href=\"https://t.co/TQfEgQxB8p\">pic.twitter.com/TQfEgQxB8p</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Farhan (@lamkanahraf) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lamkanahraf/status/1175374107493273601?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 21, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">my heart is full and content seeing so many people from all walks of life fight for climate justice but am i satisfied? am i comfortable? no. this is not enough. we want change. we want climate justice. and we want it RIGHT NOW. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MYClimateStrike?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MYClimateStrike</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ClimateAction?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ClimateAction</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/daruratiklim?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#daruratiklim</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/t3SQgyMO7D\">pic.twitter.com/t3SQgyMO7D</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 kitsch (@nightlockheart) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nightlockheart/status/1175420414777950209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 21, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<h4><strong>Stop forest fires in Indonesia</strong></h4>\n<p>Reports indicated that more than a thousand young people <a href=\"https://jakartaglobe.id/vision/climate-defenders-strike-back\">marched</a> in Jakarta on 20 September.

These are things that people all have adapted to and accepted for the most part. Coal mining and oil drilling are going that same route.

Prior to leaving the country, he had worked with local non-government organizations and had prepared multiple complaints brought before the European Court of Human Rights on behalf of Azerbaijani citizens.</p>\n<p>But after answering a few questions from authorities, he crossed the border and passed through customs. There was less to fear. Or so he thought.</p>\n<p>Then everything changed. For me, it began with a message on my phone's screen: \u201cEmin Aslan detained\u201d. It took me a minute to process this news about my friend. I had just spoken with Emin's fianc\u00e9e two days before and we had made plans to see one another in the coming months. How could it be?

Other transgender people and non-transgender supportive members also played their role in the execution of the march and its success. Sathi Foundation is a transgender-led organization working for the welfare of the transgender community in Pakistan.</p>\n\n<p>The march was attended by nearly 250 transgender people from all provinces of Pakistan. Prominent among them were Kami Sid, Bebo from Sindh, Nadra from KPK, Anmol from Sahiwal District, Nayab from Okara, Sunaina Khan (Classical Dancer), Naghma &amp; Lucky (Coke Studio Singers), Laila Naz and Neeli Rana. The event started with a <a href=\"https://timesofislamabad.com/01-Jan-2019/pakistan-s-first-ever-trans-pride-parade-held\">Press Conference</a> at the Lahore Press Club where the demands of the community were presented; after which they marched to Al Hamra Cultural Complex on the Mall dancing and singing songs on the way, where they dispersed after food.</p>\n<p>Even though the press conference was held in the Lahore Press Club the Pride March was not covered by mainstream media. Although organizers invited officials, like Punjab MNA <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadia_Sohail_Rana\">Saadia Sohail</a> from Pakistan <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Tehreek-e-Insaf\">Tehreek e Insaf</a>, government officials didn't attend the event.

Even as authorities are attempting to improve the situation, challenges remain regarding human rights protections in Togo. Citizens, for their part, are doing their best to construct a state where respect for human rights is prioritized.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the case of Elias Atayi, or Eli Amate Ataya as he is known to the state. He is an artist committed to the cause of human rights, a columnist, and co-host of the show</span>\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Klke_ajouDA\">Nek'tar on TVT</a>,<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a Togolese TV channel. He is one of the few artists regularly denounces abuse and raises awareness of the rights of women and children through his music. He uses his art to bring about positive change, as seen in this YouTube video:\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://fr.globalvoices.org\">Global Voices</a> met with Elias Atayi via Whatsapp to understand more about his approach to activism.</p>\n<p><b>Jean Sovon (JS): Where does this love of music come from?</b></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Elias Atayi\u00a0 (EA)</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Music is innate and I have practiced it since I was young. Growing up, I went to music classes from Togolese musicians such as</span>\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@RenyaOfficiel\">Gospel Renya</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@editogovi2374\">Edi Togovi</a>. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I went to music groups and choruses. I started playing instruments including my guitar, which has always been my faithful friend. I joined the University of Lom\u00e9 orchestra where I saw many names go through who are now established Togolese artists</span>: Foganne with whom I released <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ARWwWFEXp6s\">Mon R\u00eave</a> (a song which paints the world in white) and <a href=\"https://youtube.com/@vblabel1773\">Victoire Biaku</a> (winner of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Voice_Afrique_Francophone\">The Voice Francophone Africa</a>).</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>JS: In your songs, we sense a commitment to human rights. Why do you use your music to address human rights issues? </b></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>EA: </strong>In 2018, I joined the Documentation and Training Center for Human Rights (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/CdfdhT?s=20&amp;t=doz07zJPPZJUsC-z7MWKPg\">CDFDH</a>). During various trainings and activities in the field, my commitment became stronger. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this framework, the opportunity was given to me to compose and record a song accompanying</span>\u00a0<a href=\"https://youtu.be/pwXqJPIN3EY\">Xonam</a>, an app used to defend human rights. It was a beautiful experience and it reinforced my commitment. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The concept is simple: the message and means must be adapted to the goal. If young people like rap, let's bring them ideas about human rights with rap. I am one of those who thinks that the artist has a big role in achieving the</span> Sustainable Development Goals <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals\">ODD</a>. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The artist is heard, loved, and followed by millions of people. Their message and pleas will therefore have a greater impact and initiate more change from their followers. Because music is found in all homes, and when music is well-played, the lyrics stay anchored in the mind without us knowing it. This is the goal of my work: that the lyrics of songs have an impact on habits and behaviors. During Covid, when the pandemic was at its height, we released two</span> singles (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/UeveyN4s5Ng\">Respecte les mesures</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/4nsZ_1IW9a8\">La proph\u00e9tie</a>) <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to raise awareness among the population about the pandemic and its harmful effects. The message was well received even if these songs were not hits, I think it\u2019s a start, especially since our means were limited.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><b>JS: What is your impression of the human rights situation in Togo today?</b></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>EA: </strong>There is still a lot of work to be done, especially in rural communities; millions of people who do not know their rights, women abused without a voice, uneducated children \u2013 especially girls. It\u2019s true there has been progress, but we are far from meeting the minimum.The human rights situation in Togo in the 80\u2019s is nothing like the 2000\u2019s. But we must do more to find new strategies, new ways of involving the youth, women, and children. We must bring joy and light to millions of youth in remote areas by organizing various initiatives based on human rights themes, as well as practical training to equip our population. We are ready to hit the ground running.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><b>JS: Besides music, what other ways do you contribute to the advancement to human rights in Togo?</b></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>EA: </strong>In 2019 I created my organization <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Erfa.int\">Equal Rights For All</a> (ERFA) t<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">o promote human rights and civic participation in art, culture, and sport.\u00a0 A bet not easily placed given the role art takes in politics. Yes, it takes art to promote human rights because people who do not know their rights will not be able to defend them. Often, people do not know whether the oppressor is violating their rights or not. Therefore they sit powerlessly in situations where they should seek justice for violations committed and demand respect for their rights. Currently, we have outlined several strategies that are very innovative and youthful. We have planned dance competitions, football matches, marathons, film nights, and a series bringing together local comedians around our theme. All these actions are aimed towards young people who are our first priority.\u00a0</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><b>JS: Do you plan on making an album that would be dedicated to this cause?</b></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>EA: </strong>A 12-track album called Life\u2019s Colors about which we find themes like Child in the Street, Civic Engagement, Peace, No to Violent Extremism, Environment Protection, Equality, etc. I am also focused on authenticity, Africa, its culture, its rhythms. It will be a purely human rights album with African sounds.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><b>JS: Any final words for our readers?</b></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>EA: </strong>We believe in a better world and we believe that art, culture, and sport can bring a radical change and enormous impact. I am calling on my fellow artists : it is time to convey important messages without too much vulgarity. With what we see and hear today in the media, I fear for our young brothers and our children. Regarding the organization, we have planned a campaign which will be launched shortly on networks followed by strong actions, but I would like to already raise awareness through this interview.\u00a0</span></p></blockquote>\n</div>",

        "date": "29 November 2018",
        "author": "Nourhan Nassar",
        "link": "https://globalvoices.org/2018/11/29/activists-in-lebanon-are-taking-on-the-countrys-stray-bullet-problem/",
        "content": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>Reem Shaker was only 18 years old when a <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2RtrGMH\">stray bullet struck</a> her head on the balcony of her family home in the Lebanese city of Miniyeh. The shot which killed her was fired not in retribution, but in jubilation by a group celebrating the return of their loved ones from a pilgrimage to Mecca.</p>\n<p>Reem\u2019s story is one example in a series of senseless deaths caused by celebratory gunfire.</p>\n<p>The global Small Arms Survey estimates that as of 2017 in Lebanon, <a href=\"http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/Weapons_and_Markets/Tools/Firearms_holdings/SAS-BP-Civilian-held-firearms-annexe.pdf\">1,927,000 civilians</a>\u00a0possess firearms. With a population of 6,105,000, almost one-third of Lebanese civilians own a firearm. According to the <a href=\"http://www.ppm-lebanon.org/\">Permanent Peace Movement</a>, 90 people were killed in 2017 alone due to stray bullets shot at weddings and other joyous occasions mired by bloodshed.</p>\n<p>This incident is particularly close to the hearts of Tripoli\u2019s Farha Taysheh (\u201cStray Bullets Kill Joy\u201d) campaign organisers. Marwa Seif, who helped launch the campaign earlier this year, was one of Reem\u2019s closest friends, and for a long time, she felt a sense of helplessness in confronting the cause of her friend\u2019s death.</p>\n<p>But in May 2018, an unlikely group of people gathered around a table in Beirut would change things. Seif joined youth from the city of Tripoli, members from the Local Prevention Network (LPN) in Tripoli, and a mediator from the municipality to organise.</p>\n<p>Local Prevention Networks, led by the Strong Cities Network (SCN), aims to build the infrastructure of community-led initiatives by bridging the gap between grassroots organisations and the municipality.</p>\n<p>Seif\u2019s story struck a chord.</p>\n<p>Sitting across the table, Duaa, another participant in the workshop, shared her story: she had lost her sister fifteen years earlier to a stray bullet, this time in a hunting accident. Najia, a mediator at the municipality of Tripoli and Tripoli LPN member, listened intently to Duaa\u2019s story.</p>\n<p>While the primary focus of the LPNs is on tackling violent extremism through a preventative lens, they end up addressing a wide range of local issues. The networks set their own agendas. Their endorsement of the campaign was an acknowledgment of the scope of preventative initiatives.</p>\n<p>In the months that followed, Seif and Duaa worked with Najia to develop and launch their campaign Farha Taysheh. This municipal endorsement set celebratory gun violence on the agenda of the local government.</p>\n<p>Along with other volunteers, Seif and Duaa organised performance art with a social message: a wedding celebration in downtown Tripoli, where actors would react to the feigned death of a wedding guest following a stray bullet shot by another guest. The performance was filmed and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/far7ataysha/videos/282765639235079/?__tn__=-R\">shared on Facebook,</a> sparking dialogue and gaining media coverage.</p>\n<p>Farha Taysheh is one campaign among many that attempt to fight the inevitable violence resulting from gun possession \u2014 whether intentional or not. The municipal support gave youth activists a strong platform to reach a wider audience. The large-scale performance staged by the activists in downtown Tripoli would not have\u00a0been possible without the permission of local authorities.</p>\n<p>The collaboration between grassroots youth campaigners and local government contributed to the success of this campaign in Tripoli, but the context of each city differs and community-led prevention networks may choose to begin addressing less controversial topics as they build trust, credibility and confidence in addressing harder edge issues.</p>\n<p>Combined with the energy of the youth activists, Farha Taysheh has been resoundingly successful, sparking a city-wide conversation across local media platforms. Perhaps this is because stray bullets are a global problem \u2014 not just a Lebanon-specific issue \u2014 and exists all over the world, from the Balkans to the U.S.</p>\n<p>In 2017, Texas state representative Armando \u201cMando\u201d Martinez <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/armando-martinez-texas-state-representative-hit-in-head-stray-bullet-new-years-eve/\">was injured</a> in the head by a stray bullet from New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations. Two years earlier, a 10-year-old girl <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-35205145\">was killed by a stray bullet</a> at a wedding in Macedonia. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles, California police department use its social media platforms <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lapdhq/status/814582422335426560\">to warn citizens not to shoot</a> in the air with criminal prosecution and serious jail time as a consequence.</p>\n<p>Gun culture cannot be exempt from this conversation. The common thread between countries where stray bullets are a problem is that gun ownership is culturally acceptable. However, the scale of stray bullets incidents differs. In Lebanon, a partial disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) programme after the civil war (1975-1991) meant that firearms from fighting factions were never completely confiscated.</p>\n<p>Celebratory gunfire is a global issue and combating it will involve addressing some of the factors that allow it to persist. This requires addressing the widespread acceptance of firearm possession and lack of accountability of the shooters.</p>\n<p>Local initiatives have a key role to play. In the case of Farha Taysheh<i>, </i>cooperation between youth activists and the municipality of Tripoli is an example of how unlikely parties can come together to combat a common issue \u2014 one stray bullet at a time.</p>\n<p><i>Editor's note: Farha Tayshe was born out of a workshop organised by Young Cities in Beirut (May 2018). The workshop brought together youth activists and members of the Strong Cities Network (SCN) Local Prevention Network (LPN), including municipal representatives. </i><i>Young Cities is a joint initiative between the Strong Cities Network and Youth Civil Activism Network. </i></p>\n</div>",

But alarms spread panic, also challenging the capacities of security forces, which have stepped up control checks in recent months.</p>\n<p>Bomb threatsstarted in December 2021 and intensified from April to June. The attempt to create a situation of general threat comes at a time when Russian aggression on Ukraine is continuing, and the Western Balkans, including Kosovo, have not been immune to Russia's hybrid war. This is done mainly through false news and statements such as those <a href=\"https://prishtinainsight.com/vucic-denial-of-recak-massacre-sparks-outrage-in-kosovo/\">denying the crimes against humanity committed by Serbia in Kosovo</a> during the last war, 1998\u201399.</p>\n<p>But, unlike <a href=\"https://www.evropaelire.org/a/serbi-kercenimet-me-bomba-/31857625.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">other countries of the region</a>, which provided more details about the perpetrators and the addresses whence the threats came, the Kosovo authorities have not provided any reasonable explanation.</p>\n<h3><strong>73 bomb alerts in one day</strong></h3>\n<p>On June 16, the same day two <a href=\"https://www.kosovopolice.com/angazhimet-policore-lidhur-me-mbarevajtjen-e-protestes/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">protests</a> were held in Pristina \u2014 one by KLA veteran organizations\u00a0 and the other by KEK union \u2014 there were <a href=\"https://www.koha.net/arberi/330609/73-alarme-te-rrejshme-gjate-dites-se-enjte-ne-kosove/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">73 false bomb alerts</a> in the Gjilan/Gnjilane region and the Serb-majority northern municipalities. This activated the relevant police units, which carried out detailed checks at those locations. However, in the end, all the alarms turned out to be\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.kosovopolice.com/njoftim-shtese-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">false</a>. On this occasion, Minister of Internal Affairs Xhelal Sve\u00e7la <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid02T3feSA8g9XzTvmUsxDtnNRDX8oDeSZ6onxDBx15dbRfLgmMbo5QMfdNCuWGpQsWBl&amp;id=100063788556625&amp;__cft__%5b0%5d=AZWW8hNZi8oIAJpFa7hkPpEUY2orPePyp1cFHteZI9ao3gPQqyLY5qf2XoMdSHV527a26w_6bFO-kxji1xDEu4a60NpSPOjFcre24juJjVQjPUVvccDTEf4FoBEjUUa27jQrD3BLyhqSS3LHmZUvTQouu6L4C-9NdEAAv66V7BuHmA&amp;__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">called</a> for calm and no panic, as he promised that they remain committed to providing security for all citizens.</p>\n<p>Pristina International\u00a0Airport \u201cAdem Jashari\u201d was also <a href=\"https://www.evropaelire.org/a/kercenim-me-bombe-aeroporti-i-prishtines/31901468.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">alerted with false bomb threats</a>, twice in June alone.\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/adriatikk/status/1537479985266581505\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The passengers</a>\u00a0who were on board the flight from Munich to Pristina on June 16 transmitted the pilot's message that the Pristina Airport threat was of the highest level. The plane was forced to divert to Skopje in neighboring North Macedonia, awaiting instructions based on the situation at Pristina Airport.</p>\n<p>The bomb threat on June 17 also had an effect in Switzerland. According to media reports, the Swiss security authorities, upon receiving the <a href=\"https://www.blick.ch/schweiz/zuerich/der-flieger-kam-aus-dem-kosovo-zwei-f-a-18-begleiten-swiss-maschine-nach-zuerich-id17584329.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">notification</a> of the bomb alert at Pristina Airport, activated two F/A-18 fighter jets to accompany the plane.\u00a0 <span style=\"font-size: 1.25rem;\">Swiss news portal Blick reported that eyewitnesses saw the planes flying very close together and causing sonic booms, or \u201ctwo loud noises\u201d in the Arth-Goldau SZ area around 7:15 p.m.</span></p>\n<p>A false bomb alert at the airport was also issued on June 2. Initially, it was suspected that the explosive device was on the Pristina\u2013Rome flight. <a href=\"https://www.koha.net/kronike-e-zeze/328451/alarm-i-rrejshem-per-bombe-ne-aeroportin-e-prishtines/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The bomb threat</a> was made while the plane was in the air, causing great concern to passengers. According to the airport police chief, after evacuating the passengers, the police searched the plane and baggage, but found nothing.</p>\n<h3><strong>An increase in false alarms</strong></h3>\n<p>These were not the only false bomb alarms, a phenomenon that\u00a0started at the end of last year but have increased in intensity in the recent weeks.</p>\n<p>On May 17 and 18, the Rectorate of the University of Prishtina and the high school \u201cXhevdet Doda\u201d were alerted to explosive devices in their buildings.</p>\n<p>The Rectorate received the threat directly at the official e-mail address from the sender \u201csender@5ymails.com,\u201d at 13:45.\u00a0<a href=\"https://demokracia.com/ekskluzive-ky-eshte-e-maili-kercenues-qe-mori-up-ja/?fbclid=IwAR0t_jJdTsgK8N-PswvxreV0XvGrYhSFVxV2vhjgGwKY3AksofhWEdQ9Vx0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The threatening message</a>\u00a0was written in English with the content: \u201cThe bomb in Hasan Prishtina will explode now.\u201d After receiving the threatening email, the police surrounded the area around the rectory and for several hours checked for bombs. But even this alarm turned out to be false.</p>\n<p>Bomb alerts have also been received by the media of the Serb non-majority community.</p>\n<p>One such was reported by the Serbian-language portal <a href=\"https://www.kosovo-online.com/vesti/hronika/dojava-o-bombi-u-skupstini-grada-beograda-i-cetiri-gradske-opstine-10-6-2022\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kosovo-online</a> which operates in North Mitrovica. They have also attached the threatening emails, that said: \u201cAn explosive device has been placed in your premises, which will explode exactly at 22.15. Glory to Ukraine.\u201d The email was written in Ukrainian and, according to them, was sent from an address named \u201c<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/last-defenders-mariupol-what-is-ukraines-azov-regiment-2022-05-17/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Azov Ukraine</a>.\u201d This alarm also turned out to be false.</p>\n<p>The Kosovo-online portal has a large reach in the four northern municipalities of Kosovo and is reported to broadcast\u00a0<a href=\"https://sbunker.net/disinfo/91383/manipulimi-me-incidentet-ne-lokalitetet-me-shumice-serbe-ne-kosove/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Serbian and Russian propaganda</a> in Kosovo.</p>\n<h3><strong>Interconnectedness with threats in the countries of the region</strong></h3>\n<p>In the last two months alone, several public institutions in central Belgrade and the airport in the southern city of Nis have been evacuated following bomb\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/short_news/belgrade-receives-bomb-threats-in-over-100-schools/?fbclid=IwAR27MtpejlSN9RjfHrbYhllTHY3zEEyRNj6ZjHzc-UCozj18s2tED1fe5Ks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">threats</a>. According to the Serbian Ministry of Interior, 97 primary schools and some secondary schools received bomb threats that turned out to be false after the inspections.</p>\n<p>In fact, the government in Serbia has linked the dozens of received bomb threats to the situation in Ukraine.

According to them, the persons who sent threatening emails have been identified and, since they are foreign nationals, data are being exchanged through Europol and Interpol with the police in Sweden, Lithuania, Switzerland, Russia and Hungary.</p>\n<p>In relation to Kosovo, identifying the perpetrators may be more difficult as it is not a member of <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/kosovo-fails-for-third-time-to-win-interpol-membership/29610709.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Interpol</a>, where the exchange of information would be more efficient.</p>\n<p>Since the beginning of the aggression against Ukraine, bomb alerts have become common in other countries of the region as well.

An edited version is republished here under a content partnership agreement.</em></p>\n<p>Several thousand people including queer rights activists and supporters as well as opposition leaders gathered outside the parliament building in Tbilisi on Tuesday, July 7, to protest the\u00a0<a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2021/07/06/tbilisi-pride-march-canceled-amid-violent-attacks/\">violent suppression</a> of a planned Pride march the previous day.</p>\n<p>The Pride march planned for Monday, July 6, was called off after mobs of violent homophobic protesters took to the streets following calls by the Georgian Orthodox Church. At least 53 journalists were attacked during the conflict. Similar attacks reportedly took place on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>During Tuesday\u2019s protest, which was protected by police, members of the Georgian queer community and Tbilisi Pride unfurled rainbow flags next to a metal cross illegally erected outside parliament the previous day.</p>\n<p>Police initially secured the space in front of Parliament building where activists gathered in silent protest, meanwhile, the homophobic counter-protesters gathered in front of the Kashveti church located across the parliament.</p>\n<p>Soon after, the counter-protesters broke out and laid siege to the anti-violence demonstrators on three sides, repeatedly attempting to break through the police lines. Some threw eggs or plastic bottles filled with sand, resulting in arrests.</p>\n<p>Police again refrained from deploying riot gear, including water cannons, which are frequently used against nonviolent or less violent anti-government demonstrations, including during the coronavirus pandemic and in cold weather.</p>\n<p>After several hours, police cleared the area in front of parliament and escorted the crowds away, allowing the far-right mob to reclaim the space. The groups then tore down the EU flag that hangs outside parliament and set it alight. Protesters had also removed the flag the previous day.</p>\n<p>The Interior Ministry <a href=\"https://police.ge/en/shinagan-saqmeta-saministros-informatsia-6-ivliss-rustavelis-gamzirze-politsiis-mier-gamovlenili-kanondarghvevis-faqtebis-da-matze-momkhdari-reagirebis-shesakheb/14768\">said</a> they detained 100 individuals throughout the evening, releasing 68 of them shortly after.</p>\n<p>The anti-violence demonstration was joined by several opposition groups including the Libertarian party Girchi \u2014 More Freedom, European Georgia, and Lelo.</p>\n<h3>Security alarm outside TV company Pirveli</h3>\n<p>Hate groups, including Guram Palavandishvili, who leads the Society for the Protection of Children\u2019s Rights,\u00a0were aggressive towards journalists throughout the evening.

Her <a href=\"https://minorityaze.org/en/696-blogger-huseynova-threatened-trans-folks-with-death\">burned</a> body was found on August 22, in one of the capital's residential districts.

It adds new clauses to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_nationality_law\">1955 Citizenship Act</a> allowing the Indian State to provide citizenship to six communities \u2014 Buddhists, Christians, Hindus, Jains, Parsis and\u00a0Sikhs \u2014 who are fleeing from religious and minority persecution from India's three neighboring countries. Assam is a province with 33 million people with multiple ethnicities \u2014 including many indigenous ones \u2014 and religions. Among many other complexities and historical incidents that have led to this protest is Assam Accord, a 1985 Memorandum of Settlement that provided a framework on how to deal with immigrants from Bangladesh.</p>\n<h4>What is the <a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/news-analysis/story/what-is-assam-accord-of-1985-and-how-amended-citizenship-law-challenges-it-1627965-2019-12-13\">Assam Accord</a>?</h4>\n<p>Assam saw a massive influx of refugees from Bangladesh since its formation in 1947 through the 1950s until the 1980s. From 1980\u20131984, the then Indian government led by Indira Gandhi of the Indian National Congress (INC) party engaged with those who were protesting against this influx. After the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Indira_Gandhi\">assassination</a> of Gandhi in 1984, the Indian government led by Rajeev Gandhi initiated a Memorandum of Settlement that was signed in the presence of parties from both the federal and provincial governments and representatives from the protesting unions. The Accord brought the six-year-long <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam_Movement\">Assam Movement</a> to an end which arose with a goal to identify and expel refugees from Bangladesh. The Accord made it clear that any refugee irrespective of their religious faiths who entered India before 31 December 1965 would be given citizenship and the ones who entered after this date would be illegal. The ongoing protests in Assam also highlight the alleged violation of this Accord since the recently passed Citizenship (Amendment) Act now legalizes the aforementioned refugees who entered India before 31 December 2014.</p>\n<h4>What is the National Register of Citizens (NRC)?</h4>\n<p>Tensions and emotions are already running high as Assam is in the process of updating 33 million citizen records to <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/national-register-of-citizens-in-assam-issue-of-illegal-foreigners-continues-to-be-a-major-political-one/articleshow/47657561.cms\">detect and deport</a> undocumented immigrants from neighbouring Bangladesh.

The old accord sought to expel refugees based on religion and did so while the new act allows these people to stay and change the culture. I think that people are upset because they had a framework for years on how to deal with refugees and now that may be gone with this new act. Perhaps we need to take a step back and look at the past accord and see how bad this was for refugees and realize that we have evolved beyond this and should accept people regardless. the new act does not seek to change the country or its traditions but to merely allow for asylum seekers to have a home.

Dr. Mira, head of the intensive care unit at Cochin Hospital in Paris, compared the current situation to \u201ccertain AIDS studies, where among prostitutes, we try things because we know that they are highly exposed and don't protect themselves.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The two researchers made these comments in the context of a discussion of trials in Europe and Australia to see if the BCG tuberculosis vaccine could be effective against the novel coronavirus. In Australia, trials are being conducted on at least <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-australia-vaccine/australia-enters-4000-healthcare-workers-in-trial-for-coronavirus-vaccine-idUSKBN21D20H\">4,000</a> health care workers.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The attitude of these researchers echoes a long, grim history of medical experimentation and exploitation in Africa, where African leaders have colluded with pharmaceutical companies \u2014 often based in Europe or the United States \u2014 to conduct trials on the most vulnerable people in society.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The researchers\u2019 remarks immediately sparked condemnation and outrage, with the trending hashtag phrase, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnnjenga/status/1246329223163371521\">\u201cAfricans are not guinea pigs.\u201d</a></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Ivorian football star Didier Drogba tweeted:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">It is totally inconceivable we keep on cautioning this.\nAfrica isn\u2019t a testing lab.\nI would like to vividly denounce those demeaning, false and most of all deeply racists words.</p>\n<p>Helps us save Africa with the current ongoing Covid 19 and flatten the curve. <a href=\"https://t.co/41GIpXaIYv\">pic.twitter.com/41GIpXaIYv</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Didier Drogba (@didierdrogba) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/didierdrogba/status/1245798251720314880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 2, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">By April 3, Dr. Mira had <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/french-doctor-apologizes-for-africa-coronavirus-test-idea/a-53014811\"><span class=\"s1\">apologized</span></a> for his comments, but only after major pushback and pressure from the France-based anti-racism group SOS Racisme. Dr. Locht\u2019s employer, however, dismissed the outrage on Twitter as \u201cfake news,\u201d saying that the remarks had been taken out of context.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">That same week, Congolese virologist Jean-Jacque Muyembe, who worked on the frontlines of the Ebola epidemic in Democratic Republic of Congo, <a href=\"https://www.news24.com/Africa/News/dr-congo-prepared-to-take-part-in-vaccine-testing-official-20200404\"><span class=\"s1\">announced</span></a> that DR Congo \u201cis prepared to take part in testing of any future vaccine against the coronavirus,\u201d according to News 24.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Muyembe, the head of the nation\u2019s pandemic task force and national health institute, told a news conference:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">We've been chosen to conduct these tests \u2026 The vaccine will be produced in the United States, or in Canada, or in China. We're candidates for doing the testing here.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">Once again, the remarks drew ire from Congolese citizens and netizens around the world condemning Dr. Muyembe\u2019s openness to hosting clinical trials in DR Congo, where the rates of infection for COVID-19 are still <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">relatively low</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Within hours, Dr. Muyembe clarified his statements in a video message, confirming that the vaccine would only be trialed in DR Congo after it had been done in countries such as the US and China:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Yesterday Dr Jean-Jacques Muyembe announced that DRC was among Countries where Covid-19 vaccine wld be trialled.\nHe has now clarified saying \u2018vaccine wld only be tried in the DRC after trials in Countries like US &amp; China\u2019 &amp; that he wldnt allow Congolese ppl to be \u2018Guinea pigs\u2019 <a href=\"https://t.co/EZ3TLoxs2A\">pic.twitter.com/EZ3TLoxs2A</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Samira Sawlani (@samirasawlani) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/samirasawlani/status/1246221186331271168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 3, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">A grim history of medical experiment in Africa</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Medical experimentation in Africa \u2014 often conducted under the guise of the \u201cgreater good\u201d and of finding cures for deadly diseases like meningitis and HIV/AIDS \u2014 has sounded ethical and moral alarm bells for years \u2014 particularly over informed consent and forced medical procedures.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">These trials are often funded by leading health organizations like the World Health Organization, the United States\u2019 Centers for Disease Control and the National Institute of Health.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In Zimbabwe, in the 1990s, over 17,000 HIV-positive women were <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_experimentation_in_Africa#HIV/AIDS_testing_in_Zimbabwe:_1990s\"><span class=\"s1\">tested without informed consent</span></a> in trials for the anti-retroviral drug AZT funded by the CDC, WHO and the NIH.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In the 1990s, the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/pfizer-lawsuit-re-nigeria\"><span class=\"s1\">tested an experimental drug </span></a>called Trovan on 200 children in Kano, Nigeria, during an epidemic of bacterial meningitis. Several families filed and won a lawsuit against Pfizer on the basis of violation of informed consent.</p>\n<p>Medical experimentation is not only entrenched in the history of racism and colonialism \u2014 it also sets a dangerous precedent by <a href=\"https://apnews.com/ccc9272c130f440796f51cc778e50b64\">eroding the critical trust</a> between citizens and health authorities.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cBoth European colonialism and biomedicine reciprocally extended and strengthened the reach of the other,\u201d writes Patrick Malloy in an academic paper entitled, <a href=\"https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3687950361/research-material-and-necromancy-imagining-the-political-economy\">\u201cResearch Material and Necromancy: Imagining the Political-Economy of Biomedicine in Colonial Tanganyika.\u201d\u00a0</a></span></p>\n<p>From malaria to other \u201cplague-like\u201d conditions, colonial authorities often subjected African subjects to the non-consensual practice of specimen-sample collection and \u201c\u2026<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">African blood was appropriated to feed colonial-era medical research,\u201d Malloy writes. He continues:\u00a0</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Tanganyika as well as other African colonies, this meant that colonial subjects could be called upon to surrender tissue samples, literally portions of themselves, to the medical authorities.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>These practices overlapped with horrifying rumors in East Africa about \u201cgangs\u201d of people employed by Europeans who would kidnap Africans to withdraw their blood to make a gum-like medicine known as\u00a0<em>mumiani. </em>The Swahili term invokes the image of the <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=y5DcCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT79&amp;lpg=PT79&amp;dq=mumiani&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DK8cPvajUN&amp;sig=ACfU3U05E-C2dxk1PRsRHAAIKUqcupLoXQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ppis=_e&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjm_obzvuDoAhVSCs0KHXpeB-84ChDoATAJegQICxA0#v=onepage&amp;q=mumiani&amp;f=false\">\u201cvampire\u201d or\u00a0\u201cbloodletter\u201d</a> \u2014 which has also become synonymous with \u201cexploitation.\u201d</p>\n<p>This grim history has sown seeds of deep mistrust in vaccinations, medical trials and experiments in Africa, and continues to haunt decisions made by health authorities working in sync with government officials and global pharmaceutical companies.</p>\n<p>That 1990s meningitis trial debacle in Kano, Nigeria, sowed so much distrust that it later made it very difficult to promote critical polio testing. Anti-polio <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RMAjayi/status/1141267610220269568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">vaccine rumors</a> flourished. Those rumors got disseminated as news and eventually translated into a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1831725/\">regional policy banning the polio vaccine</a> in Nigeria in 2003.</p>\n<h3>Recovering from colonial \u2018hangovers\u2019</h3>\n<p>So, what does this all mean for potential COVID-19 trials in Africa? Netizens and activists have resoundingly expressed the view that \u201cAfricans are not guinea pigs.\u201d</p>\n<p>WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-52192184\">labeled</a> the attitude of the two French doctors a \u201changover\u201d from a \u201ccolonial mentality\u201d and declared:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Africa can't and won't be a testing ground for any vaccine.</p></blockquote>\n<p>However, deep-seated fear and distrust of medical experimentation has also turned contact tracing and testing to stem the spread of the highly contagious coronavirus into an uphill battle for health care workers.</p>\n<p>In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire on April 6, protesters <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-52189144\">burned down a COVID-19 testing center</a>, claiming its location in a crowded area was not appropriate. The attack was \u201creminiscent of attitudes during Ebola outbreaks in West and Central Africa when some people attacked health workers, suspicious that they were bringing the disease to their communities, rather than offering crucial medical care,\u201d BBC reported.</p>\n<p>Yet, in the throes of the 2018 Ebola outbreak in DR Congo, critical human trials <a href=\"https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/clinical-trial-investigational-ebola-treatments-begins-democratic-republic-congo\">administered</a> to Ebola patients\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.who.int/ebola/drc-2018/notes-for-the-record-meuri-ebola.pdf\">\u201cunder an ethical framework\u201d</a>\u00a0\u2014 under the medical guidance of Dr. Muyembe and the government of DR Congo \u2014 ultimately saved lives. By November 2019, a vaccine had been<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03490-8\"> approved</a> after thousands of Congolese with Ebola were tested.</p>\n<p>WHO was expected to <a href=\"https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/news/2020/04/07/congo-ebola-coronavirus-relapse\">declare</a> the DR Congo Ebola-free on April 12, but after more than 50 days without a single case, a 26-year-old man <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ebola-congo/ebola-patient-dies-in-congo-first-case-in-50-days-idUSKCN21S1P5\">contracted</a> Ebola and died on April 10.</p>\n<p>Now, in addition to Ebola and an ongoing humanitarian crisis, DR Congo must turn its attention to mitigating the spread of the coronavirus.</p>\n<p>There are currently <a href=\"https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/key-action/Novel-Coronavirus_Landscape_nCoV-4april2020.pdf?ua=1\">62 efforts underway</a> to find a vaccine for COVID-19. Responsible, ethical vaccine trials take time and attention. Will big pharmaceutical companies <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/most-experimental-drugs-are-tested-offshore-raising-concerns-about-data/\">maintain the same ethical standards</a> in Africa that they usually adhere to in trials conducted in the West?</p>\n</div>",

Check out Global Voices\u2019 special coverage of<a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/specialcoverage/covid-19-global-coverage-for-a-pandemic/\">\u00a0the global impact of COVID-19</a>.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Democratic Republic of Congo has officially<a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/democratic-republic-congo-s-last-ebola-patient-discharged\"><span class=\"s1\"> declared</span></a> no more Ebola patients. On Tuesday, March 3, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the last patient was discharged in good health from a treatment center in Beni, North Kivu, eastern DR Congo.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This is not yet the end of the epidemic, but it is a victory: Beni used to be the epicenter of Ebola in DR Congo.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">But while DR Congo has proclaimed the end of Ebola, it faced its first case of COVID-19 \u2014 the potentially deadly disease caused by a novel coronavirus \u2014\u00a0on March 8, 2020,and <a href=\"https://www.afro.who.int/news/first-case-covid-19-confirmed-democratic-republic-congo\"><span class=\"s1\">confirmed</span></a> by WHO on March 10.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The first case was reported in Kinshasa, the capital. The patient is Congolese, 52, who returned to DR Congo from France. Upon arrival, he showed no symptoms. However, he was taken to a clinic in the Commune of Ndji'li, according to a statement issued by the Ministry of Health, who added that health services are working to trace and identify all persons who have been in contact with the patient since March 8, 2020.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">There are now at least\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus-covid-19\"><span class=\"s1\">23 confirmed cases</span></a> in DR Congo, as of March 22, according to WHO, including one virus-related <a href=\"https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/DR-Congo-reports-first-virus-death-five-new-cases/688334-5499440-e405e4/index.html\">death</a>.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"fr\">Hier l'INRB a confirm\u00e9 5 nouveaux cas.

The government also <a href=\"https://www.iol.co.za/news/africa/drc-strengthens-border-security-suspends-overseas-flights-to-fight-covid-19-45239276\"><span class=\"s1\">suspended all international flights</span></a> from countries with a high number of cases of COVID-19.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Mory Keita, the WHO coordinator who works in Ebola-affected regions, <a href=\"https://amp.rfi.fr/fr/afrique/20200304-plus-aucun-cas-ebola-rdc\"><span class=\"s1\">said </span></a>the keyword is continued vigilance when it comes to containing any infectious disease. He points out that vaccination so that people can prevent themselves from getting any case of the virus.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In North Kivu province, the Ebola virus <a href=\"https://www.who.int/csr/don/19-March-2020-ebola-drc/en/\"><span class=\"s1\">killed</span></a> more than 2,000 people. There were 3,400 cases, and 1,169 were cured since August 1, 2018.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Nzanzu Carly Kasivita, governor of North Kivu, took decisive measures to fight Ebola in his region. Kasivita told Global Voices:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">As governor, I organized support marches so that the population of North Kivu can adopt the best attitudes to fight against Ebola and I managed to mobilize the population, I am happy to announce that there are now more than 21 days without cases of Ebola virus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">On July 17, 2019, WHO <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/17-07-2019-ebola-outbreak-in-the-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-declared-a-public-health-emergency-of-international-concern\"><span class=\"s1\">proclaimed</span></a> Ebola as a public health emergency of international concern, which quickly mobilized more resources and support to combat Ebola in three provinces of eastern DR Congo: North Kivu, South Kivu and Uturi.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jean-Jacques Muyembe, technical secretary of response in DR Congo, told Global Voices by phone that since March 2, 2020, the last patients have been cured and have been released from the Ebola Treatment Center.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">However, according to WHO, it takes <a href=\"https://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/declaration-ebola-end/en/\"><span class=\"s1\">42 days</span></a> from the confirmation of the last case for the virus to be declared completely eradicated: April 12, 2020.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Muyembe said that the same population that fought against Ebola can also avoid coronavirus, using the lessons learned from prior Ebola outbreaks.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Confronting coronavirus in DR Congo</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Coronavirus is bad news for the region so strongly affected by Ebola. However, the two highly infectious diseases have several commonalities, albeit Ebola was much more contagious than COVID-19.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">According to Muyembe, most Congolese are aware of and prepared for COVID-19 after living with the Ebola epidemic. Health workers will use similar measures in terms of contact tracing and social and physical distancing to fight the coronavirus.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cDRC was the 11th African country affected by COVID-2019, but the same protective attitudes that fought against Ebola must be maintained in the phase of this new virus,\u201d Muyembe told Global Voices.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Muyembe explained that the council of ministers finally decided that anyone coming from France, Germany, Italy, Iran, Iraq and China, even \u201cwithout any signs of fever, cough, cold, headache, intense fatigue will be isolated for 14 days at home and followed for 14 days by the medical team taking into account the information collected in the health cards of travelers.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In addition, Muyembe told Global Voices that any person \u201cpresenting [coronavirus] symptoms on arrival and considered a suspect case will be transferred to the isolation site and treated by the Ministry of Health.\u201d</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, experts with WHO say they plan to conduct a <a href=\"https://qz.com/1821933/who-could-use-ebola-study-as-model-for-coronavirus-treatment/\">study</a> called \u201cSolidarity\u201d modeled after a 2018 Ebola study, to test drugs already used to tackle other viruses.</p>\n<p>The study will likely need to enroll thousands of patients, which could prove difficult depending on government efficacy to manage the collaboration with WHO. But the results could save many lives.</p>\n</div>",

Of course they could do more since they had information they were more than likely trying t suppress from the world about this virus and what it would do to a city. They could have used that information to begin to mobilize the equipment they would need in order to better support the residents of Wuhan once they knew they would quarantine and shit down the city. We all should stand with Wuhan and its residents at this moment. They have been let down by their government, and that saddens me.",

I don't know that alternative medicines would have been an effective option to address the outbreak either, but the government could have taken some measures that both addressed the potential seriousness of the virus while also respecting the basic rights and dignity of its citizens. Expanding health care options temporarily, making masks more readily available, and encouraging people who were feeling sick to limit their activity to staying home or seek medical care would have been a potential alternative way to deal with the crisis in a less brutal manner. This was a truly difficult time and the government had to make difficult decisions without a whole lot of time to think through the ramifications, but positive and direct communication with people in the city as well as neighboring areas would have cut down on anxiety and panic feelings, helping to improve things. Wuhan's residents were resilient during a really challenging period and should be praised for how well they persevered through the adversity.",

        "title": "In Turkey, a football federation joins a list of institutions with powers to censor content online",
        "date": "18 November 2022",
        "author": "Arzu Geybullayeva",
        "link": "https://globalvoices.org/2022/11/18/in-turkey-a-football-federation-joins-a-list-of-institutions-with-powers-to-censor-content-online/",
        "content": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>In December 2021, an article added to law No. 5894 (Law on the Establishment and Duties of the Turkish Football Federation) granted the Turkish Football Federation authority to block access to broadcasts and URLs in case the federation determines the broadcasts are illegal. From the outside it may look and sound like a legitimate decision: the football federation trying to prevent illegal broadcasts of games. But looking closely, and analysing it through the prism of the pervasive environment of censorship in Turkey at the moment, granting a football federation rights to censor content in the absence of a court order is yet another sign of a narrowing environment for freedoms. Critics <a href=\"https://kronos35.news/tr/tffye-sansur-yetkisi-diledigi-web-sitesini-mahkeme-karari-olmadan-engelleyebilecek/\">described</a> the move as\u00a0 \u201cundisputed censorship\u201d and \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d Today, some <a href=\"https://www.esgazete.com/mahkeme-karari-olmadan-site-kapatmak-anayasaya-aykiridir\">twenty entities </a>have been granted powers to censor content online, including the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency, the Directorate for Religious Affairs, the Capital Markets Board, the National Lottery Administration and others.</p>\n<h3>How it works</h3>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/spor/tff-harekete-gecmisti-866-siteye-erisim-engeli-1910068\">new regulation</a>, if it is determined that the broadcasts related to football matches within the borders of the Republic of Turkey are made available on the internet, the Board of Directors (of the federation) may decide to block the access (in the form of URL) by conveying its decision to the <a href=\"https://www.esb.org.tr/en/\">Access Providers Association</a>. The association then blocks the site. In case the requested content cannot be blocked, the TFF Board of Directors <a href=\"https://www.morogluarseven.com/news-and-publications/turkish-football-federation-is-authorized-to-block-illegal-broadcasts/\">can decide to block access</a> to an entire site (in the absence of court approval.)</p>\n<p>The blocking decision can be appealed at the Criminal Judgeship of Peace within a week of blocking taking place. Persons in the unit established within the TFF to implement the access ban decision can also authorise blocking if requested. By February 2022, the federation had successfully <a href=\"https://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/spor/tff-harekete-gecmisti-866-siteye-erisim-engeli-1910068\">blocked</a> access to over 800 sites. The censorship applies to video content including match summaries, score footage from the games, and entire sites due to these broadcasts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www-freewebturkey-com.translate.goog/turkiye-futbol-federasyonuna-sansur-yetkisi/?_x_tr_sl=tr&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=sc\">According</a> to lawyer Kerem Altiparmak, from a legal point of view, the authority given to the TFF is unconstitutional and paves the way for censorship. Altiparmak points out that the biggest problem with the authority given to the TFF is the seven-day deadline to appeal the blocking decision. \u201cThere is a measurement problem here. Why seven days? The Information Technologies Authority [(BTK] makes a decision on blocking access in matters related to public order and national security, and yet this decision is submitted to the judge's approval within 24 hours. Under normal circumstances, if such authorization is given, they should have submitted to the approval of the judge within 24 hours and brought a condition for repeal.\u201d</p>\n<p>The Criminal Judgeships of Peace are often used as censorship mechanisms in cases of blocked content. Established in 2014, the Criminal Judgeships of Peace are <a href=\"https://www.icj.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Turkey-Judgeship-Advocacy-Analysis-brief-2018-ENG.pdf\">the first to order</a> blocking decisions. They also lack impartiality. According to an internal system of appeals, a peace judge can appeal to another peace judge making the process contrary to the rule of law. In most of the cases documented until now, the appeals made to one criminal judgeship of peace based on the decision of another criminal judgeship\u00a0 of peace <a href=\"https://www.englishpen.org/campaigns/turkey-freedom-of-expression-in-jeopardy/\">have been rejected</a>. This horizontal system of appeals was <a href=\"https://www.icj.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Turkey-Judgeship-Advocacy-Analysis-brief-2018-ENG.pdf\">criticised</a> by the Council of Europe\u2019s Venice Commission, the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression.</p>\n<p>These courts are often used by state officials, ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) members, and other state allies <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2022/06/03/trace-turkeys-path-to-normalizing-the-practice-of-blocking-news-websites/\">to block access</a> to social media content, individual online news items, and entire websites often critical of these actors, as well as corruption allegations involving these actors on the grounds their personal rights are violated. Even companies affiliated with or that have done business with the state can rely on these courts to block online materials where they are compromised.</p>\n<p>Another <a href=\"https://bianet.org/english/freedom-of-expression/265183-court-blocks-access-to-130-news-articles-about-erdogan-s-former-lawyer\">example</a> includes President Recept Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s former lawyer successfully managing to block access to over 170 news items mentioning the lawyer\u2019s involvement in a murky court proceeding involving Tefal and a Turkish company. The lawyer <a href=\"https://bianet.org/english/freedom-of-expression/265183-court-blocks-access-to-130-news-articles-about-erdogan-s-former-lawyer\">applied</a> to the Istanbul 9th Criminal Judgeship of Peace twice to impose an access block on all the news items mentioning his name, the first time getting the court to block some 130 articles and the second time another 40 articles.</p>\n<p>The list of online news items blocked on the orders of criminal judgeships of peace is long and continues to grow. Some of these websites <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2022/06/03/trace-turkeys-path-to-normalizing-the-practice-of-blocking-news-websites/\">face blocking consistently</a>. Etkin News Agency (ETHA) was blocked more than 40 times according to the <a href=\"https://www.freewebturkey.com/ethaya-sansur-kiskaci-40-kez-engellendi-tum-hesaplari-kapatildi/\">Free Web Turkey Platform</a>. The blocking also extended to ETHA's Twitter account based on a government request backed by a decision of the Diyarbakir Criminal Judgeship of Peace. ETHA\u2019s Facebook account has been blocked since 2018, also through a court order. On September 12, the <a href=\"http://etha48.com/haberdetay/ethaya-yine-erisim-engeli-164777\">court ruled </a>to block the website for the 47th time.</p>\n<p>In July, 2022 upon request of the first lady Emine Erdogan, the 2nd Criminal Judgeship of Peace in Istanbul ruled in favour of her request <a href=\"https://bianet.org/bianet/medya/264849-emine-erdogan-istedi-erisim-engeli-haberlerine-erisim-engeli-geldi\">to block access</a> to news items mentioning her connection to an environment agency that has recently been granted tenders along Turkish coasts. This was a unique example of double censorship in Turkey. The first ban blocked access to the news about the Environment Law and changes made to the law authorising the environment agency to hold tenders for eyebolts and buoys along the entire coast of Turkey. The second access ban concerned the news items about the first blocking. But this was <a href=\"https://stockholmcf.org/turkeys-first-lady-seeks-to-censor-negative-reports-about-her-in-internet/\">not the first </a>time the family of Erdo\u011fan were successful at getting news blocked <a href=\"https://stockholmcf.org/turkeys-first-lady-seeks-to-censor-negative-reports-about-her-in-internet/\">mentioning their names</a> or other ruling party members. In 2021, Free Web Turkey, <a href=\"https://www.freewebturkey.com/free-web-turkey-report-42-of-blocked-news-are-related-to-government-and-its-close-circles/\">published</a> a report in which the independent watchdog documented blocking of 1,910 URLs through 150 court decisions mentioning either President Erdo\u011fan , his family members, other AKP members or the state overall. Most recently <a href=\"https://ifade.org.tr/engelliweb/cumhurbaskani-recep-tayyip-erdogan-hakkinda-cizilen-karikaturlerle-ilgili-haberler/\">in August 2022</a>, news items that have used images by Brazilian cartoonist Latuff of President Erdo\u011fan were censored in Turkey through the ruling of Istanbul Anadolu 1st Criminal Judgeship of Peace on the grounds of personal rights violations.</p>\n<h3>Absolute media capture</h3>\n<p>An investigation <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/turkey-erdogan-media/\">published</a> by Reuters in August 2022, revealed how the media in Turkey \u201chas become a tight chain of command of government-approved headlines, front pages and topics of TV debate.\u201d Based on interviews with the media, state officials, and regulators, the report is a sobering overview of the extent of media capture and control mechanisms that have been introduced over the years in a country that once had a thriving media environment. The censorship <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2022/07/01/turkey-blocks-access-to-two-news-websites/\">has been consistent</a> and <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2022/06/03/trace-turkeys-path-to-normalizing-the-practice-of-blocking-news-websites/\">normalised</a> across all avenues, including the i<a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2021/11/03/turkey-new-report-highlights-the-extent-of-censorship-online/\">nternet</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.freewebturkey.com/sosyal-medya-yasasi-bilgi-alma-ve-yayma-hakkinin-tabutuna-son-civi-cakiliyor/\">social media platforms</a> that have been <a href=\"https://advox.globalvoices.org/2021/02/11/turkey-reins-in-social-media-one-platform-at-a-time/\">forced to comply</a> with the national laws.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Please visit the project page for more pieces from the\u00a0<a href=\"https://advox.globalvoices.org/special/unfreedom-monitor/\">Unfreedom Monitor</a>.</h3>\n\n</div>",

They charge that Aadhaar runs afoul of the court verdict.\n</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These critiques have made it clear that India needs a stronger definition of \u201cdata\u201d, personal, sensitive and otherwise.

Visit the <a href=\"https://digitalid.theengineroom.org/\"><span class=\"s1\">Digital ID microsite</span></a> to read a full <a href=\"https://digitalid.theengineroom.org/assets/pdfs/200123_FINAL_TER_Digital_ID_Report+Annexes_English_Interactive.pdf\"><span class=\"s1\">research report</span></a> on this global trend, and case studies on five countries that have deployed digital ID systems, including <a href=\"https://digitalid.theengineroom.org/assets/pdfs/%5BEnglish%5D%20Ethiopia%20Case%20Study%20-%20DigitalID%20-%20The%20Engine%20Room.pdf\"><span class=\"s1\">Ethiopia</span></a>.</em></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In 2010, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) officially <a href=\"https://www.alnap.org/system/files/content/resource/files/main/34-1-101-1-10-20161201.pdf\"><span class=\"s1\">announced</span></a> a new digital identification (ID) program for refugees.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The new program, known as the <a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/protection/basic/550c304c9/biometric-identity-management-system.html\"><span class=\"s1\">Biometric Identity Management System (BIMS)</span></a>, was later introduced to dozens of countries \u2014 including Ethiopia \u2014 in 2017.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Biometric registration enables refugees to secure a digital ID that gives them access to a range of aid services and rights.\u00a0Although digital IDs have potential benefits in terms of boosting humanitarian response, their use has raised concerns about privacy and exclusion among refugees.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The UNHCR office in Ethiopia explained to Global Voices in an interview that the BIMS system is an additional feature of refugee registration that aims to enhance the profiling of refugees, as well as collect information to enhance self-reliance and eventual inclusion.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThe system was integrated into the comprehensive individual registration exercise to ensure data integrity and data quality,\u201d said Kisut Gebregzabiher, UNHCR spokesperson in Ethiopia.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">This is vital for refugees, as the government-recognized identity documentation can constitute proof of legal identity, which is key for the legal, socio-economic and digital inclusion of refugees within host communities. \u2026 The system also removes the risk of multiple registrations or identity theft.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">BIMS is currently implemented in all 26 refugee camps across Ethiopia as well as urban and other centers where refugees are sheltered.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Privacy concerns</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Several refugees at Jewi camp, located in the western Gambella region and Hitsats, in the northern region of Tigray, told Global Voices that the UNHCR staff never mentioned the drawbacks of biometric technology.</p>\n<p>The digital registration process captures multiple characteristics including fingerprints, iris recognition, facial structure and voice. The process, therefore, has led to concerns among refugees over privacy infringement (when data is shared with third parties) and exclusion from essential services upon refusal.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When the technology was first introduced, most refugees were not aware of the potential risks of digital registration until some of the more educated people in the camps started talking about its implications.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One South Sudanese refugee in Jewi camp who did not want his name revealed due to security concerns told Global Voices that they were briefed about the biometric registration without any explanation by camp authorities of these risks.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Digital registration could lead to serious repercussions for those refugees who do not want their information shared with either their host country or country of origin for fears of discrimination, forced repatriation or retaliation, some refugees told Global Voices.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In Hitsat camp, Eritrean refugees who were in the military fear that the Ethiopian government might share their data with the Eritrean government.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Eritrean refugees became especially concerned after the recent <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/7/31/17595988/ethiopia-eritrea-peace-abiy-ahmed\"><span class=\"s1\">rapprochement</span></a> of Ethiopia and Eritrea, who restored diplomatic ties in July 2018, ending two decades of hostility. The two neighbors fought a bloody border war from 1998 to 2000, which killed approximately<a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/peace-uncertainty-ethiopia-eritrea-deal-190708115216882.html\"> 70,000</a> people.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Biometric and personal data collected by UNHCR are reportedly shared with third parties, a claim that Gebregzabiher, the UNHCR official, rejected:\u00a0\u201cRefugee data are not shared with any external parties. The UNHCR data protection policies govern the data protection for all data owned by UNHCR.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">What also makes the digital ID registration risky is the fact that Ethiopia does not have laws specifically designed to deal with privacy and data protection issues \u2014\u00a0except <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311315946_Towards_Data_Protection_Law_in_Ethiopia\"><span class=\"s1\">a few sets of rules</span></a> contained in various pieces of legislation that guarantee the right to privacy.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cUNHCR must respect the rights of every person going through the registration process,\u2019\u2019 one Eritrean refugee told Global Voices, also emphasizing the need \u201cto understand why biometric data is being collected and how it will be used as well as the potential risks.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Gebregzabiher, the UNHCR spokesperson in Ethiopia, denied the refugees\u2019 claims. He told Global Voices that they do provide refugees with explanations on the \u201cbenefits and implications\u201d of the new system before embarking on the exercise. When Global Voices asked Gebregzabiher to clarify what he meant by \u201cimplications,\u201d he said: \u201cthe disadvantages of not implementing the digital system.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIt was clarified to the refugees that the higher standard of registration means better protection, better-targeted programming, enhanced data integrity and protection of data fraud,\u201d\u00a0Gebregzabiher told Global Voices.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Refugees who spoke to Global Voices said that frustrations are rising at camps over the potential risks of the digital ID and as a result, there is growing defiance toward the unpopular digital identification system. One refugee at Hitsats camp, who also wished to remain anonymous, said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">At first, we had no knowledge of the risks of recognition. Most of us completed the biometric registration out of honesty and due to the trust we have for UNHCR and Ethiopia.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">This person told Global Voices that they were not asked for consent before their biometric data was collected.</p>\n<p>Another refugee who also asked for anonymity due to security concerns said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">The registration process doesn\u2019t embrace consent. Being asked for consent is seen as a luxury right. We get registered as a means of force because we don\u2019t have any other option to get food or protection.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">\u2018An obligation for survival\u2019</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Refugees have been told that those who refuse to participate in the digital registration are excluded from receiving UNHCR aid such as food rations or any other assistance, essentially giving them no choice but to oblige the exercise.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Several refugees in Hitsats and Jewi camps who spoke with Global Voices by phone said they are not comfortable with the newly introduced digital registration system and question its benefits.</p>\n<p>A former Eritrean soldier who wished to remain anonymous due to security concerns said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">Unlike what the UNHCR staff is saying, the new digital registration system didn\u2019t initiate any new special benefits package. We are getting the same usual assistance like food rations and other non-food items we used to get. \u2026 I doubt if the new system would at all bring any extra aid benefits.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">For one Eritrean refugee, a mother of one who also requested anonymity, the obligation of digital registration is seen as a precondition to receiving the basic services from the UN refugee agency:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">It is appalling to see UNHCR using digital registration as an obligation for survival. \u2026 I felt like I was held hostage for food and shelter by the one UN agency trusted to lean on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">Gebregzabiher, the UNHCR spokesman, noted that he had not yet seen anyone refuse registration.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cThe launch of the exercise was preceded by a massive awareness-raising campaign so that refugees have a proper understanding of the benefits of the new registration system and collaborate with the experts doing the registration. As such, there was no resistance from refugees whatsoever,\u201d Gebregzabiher said.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">However, the refugees whom Global Voices spoke to in Ethiopia said several refugees who refused to register had to leave the camps<b>.</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One South Sudanese refugee who wished to remain anonymous said that the \u201cmajority of those who refuse registration is out of the camp since they were told to do so. Some of them stay partially in the camp and others have integrated themselves to host communities in Gambella while others had to return back to South Sudan.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Global Voices further learned that at Jewi refugee camp, followers of certain Christian groups such as Protestants, the Messianic Jewish Church of God and Congregation of Yawuhe, also refused the registration process on religious grounds.</p>\n</div>",

Apparently, Sison is included in the <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2021/10/12/facebook-secret-blacklist-dangerous/\">list</a> of Facebook\u2019s \u201cdangerous individuals and organizations.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sison, 83, died on December 16, 2022. He was jailed for nine years during the Martial Law regime until the ouster of the dictatorship in 1986. He was forced to go into exile in The Netherlands in 1987 after his passport was cancelled while he was out of the country during a global lecture tour. He served as chief political consultant of the National Democratic Front of the Philippines until his death.</p>\n<p>Despite being a political refugee in Europe, successive Philippine governments have branded him as a terrorist and accused him of directing the operations of the New People\u2019s Army, which has been waging an armed struggle for national liberation since 1969. Sison has denied this and contested his inclusion in the list of terrorists.</p>\n<p>For many activists, Sison was regarded as an outstanding activist, poet, and revolutionary whose writings have guided the emergence and growth of the Leftist movement in the Philippines.</p>\n<p>Sison is recognized in the Philippines as a historic figure and political icon. Naturally, his death drew immediate reactions from supporters, <a href=\"https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/nation/854810/rodrigo-duterte-on-sison-s-death-marks-end-of-an-era-hopefully-ends-insurgencies/story/\">adversaries</a>, and observers of Philippine politics.</p>\n<p>But Facebook\u2019s algorithm is seemingly tweaked to automatically flag posts that mention Sison and contain his images.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Carol Araullo, chair of Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (New Patriotic Alliance), <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/carolp.araullo/posts/pfbid0edRZKuJSRM4jopJZJ4iKnesAybbTTpAkVTUxtvwrJGVvTJJds2y4imdhkC1eUZPGl\">questioned the removal of her post</a> announcing a tribute event in honor of Sison:</p>\n<blockquote><p>So I finally got \u201crestricted\u201d by FB for posting the pubmat announcing the Memorial for Prof. Sison last Dec. 20.

He did not want to be a baker, but circumstances forced him to become one to remain alive.</p>\n<p>Lambert Kehven did not dream of becoming a baker, but a journalist. He started working as a journalist in Kumbo in the Bui division in the restive northwest region of Cameroon for a local media house, <a href=\"https://www.canal2international.net/\">Canal 2 International</a>. When the Anglophone conflict spiked in 2017, he found himself caught between state security forces and non-state armed groups who all wanted him to report their own sides of the story. They wanted to read his reports before they were published.</p>\n<p>Kehven was <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CAMEROONNEWSAGENCY/photos/a.653176964795358/2562703727175996/?type=3\">arrested</a> in December 2019, accused of working with non-state actors, and released on January 10, 2020, when he fled the conflict zone for his life and safety.</p>\n<p>Samuel Ajiekah Abuwe, popularly called\u00a0 <a href=\"https://cpj.org/data/people/samuel-wazizi/\">Samuel Wazizi</a>\u00a0 who reported the Anglophone conflict for Chillen Media TV, was not as fortunate.\u00a0He was arrested on August 2, 2019, supposedly because he allowed his farm to be used by armed groups and allegedly filmed military atrocities, the footage of which he supplied to the international media, the <a href=\"https://cpj.org/data/people/samuel-wazizi/\">Cameroon police told journalists</a>.</p>\n<p>Samuel Wazizi died in custody; his death was reported by Equinoxe TV during <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSenu68Mxao&amp;feature=youtu.be\">their prime time news</a> on June 2, 2019. His family has no clue where his remains could be. The military said he died of sepsis, no independent investigation has opened, and journalists dare not ask questions or investigate f<a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/anglophone-journalists-in-cameroon-fear-for-their-lives/a-49682663\">or fear of being killed.</a></p>\n<p>As Cameroonian journalists were still processing Wazizi\u2019s case, another journalist <a href=\"https://cpj.org/data/people/kingsley-fomunyuy-njoka/\">Kingsley Fomunyuy Njoka</a> was arrested on May 15, 2020, in connection with his reports and Facebook posts on the Anglophone conflict, for allegedly sourcing his information by \u201csponsoring\u201d terrorists in the region. Njoka was kept incommunicado for weeks. The military court later charged him with acts of terrorism, and he has been awaiting trial for about two years.</p>\n<p>The most recent is the murder <a href=\"https://rsf.org/en/cameroonian-journalist-martinez-zogo-s-murder-was-state-crime-official-confesses\">Martinez Zogo</a>, a radio journalist investigating corruption who disappeared and whose mutilated remains were found along the Soa road on the outskirts of Yaound\u00e9 on January 22. Reporters Without Borders describes this as a \u201cstate crime.\u201d</p>\n<p>The scenarios painted above depict how journalists who are critical in their reports on the Anglophone conflict, both online and offline, are either jailed or forced to desert the conflict zones and journalism or die in the process. These also demonstrate how far the state can go to silence dissent and suppress critical reporting.</p>\n<h3>The Anglophone conflict</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglophone_Crisis\">Anglophone conflict</a> is deeply rooted in the history of the partition of Africa where Cameroon was partitioned between France and Britain, with the former having a greater share. French Cameroons got independence first. The English side had to achieve independence by either joining French Cameroons or Nigeria. They chose to join French Cameroons to form a two-state federation, but the terms of the federation eroded, and as the English side was marginalized, which metamorphosed into a crisis and later a conflict.</p>\n<p>In 1972, a new constitution revoked the autonomy of the English-speaking parts of the country, giving more power to the president, leading to friction with the leaders of the erstwhile autonomous Anglophone region of Southern Cameroons. Neglect, marginalisation and the erosion of the terms of the federation are the <a href=\"https://www.accord.org.za/ajcr-issues/the-anglophone-problem-in-cameroon-the-change-from-crisis-to-conflict-and-a-possible-way-forward-to-resolution/\">root causes</a>\u00a0of the ongoing Anglophone conflict in Cameroon, with devastating effects.</p>\n<p>The Anglophone conflict reached its peak in 2016 when t<a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/12/5/cameroon-teachers-lawyers-strike-in-battle-for-english\">eachers and lawyers</a> took to the streets with peace plants to denounce the diluting of the Anglo Saxon systems of <a href=\"http://lespuy.com/index.php/produit/anglophone-lawyers-and-teachers-strikes-in-cameroon-2016-2017-a-multidimensional-perspective/\">education and law</a>. The state responded with <a href=\"https://www.rfi.fr/en/africa/20161122-cameroon-clashes-between-protesters-security-forces-anglophone-tensions-rise\">force</a>,<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-38078238\"> arresting and jailing the leaders</a>. Separatist tendencies took over, and <a href=\"https://www.accord.org.za/ajcr-issues/the-anglophone-problem-in-cameroon-the-change-from-crisis-to-conflict-and-a-possible-way-forward-to-resolution/\">non-state armed groups took arms</a> against the state security forces.</p>\n<p>Seven years later, the conflict is ongoing, and the government is not tolerant of critical views on its handling of the conflict.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2022/country-chapters/cameroon\">Four thousand</a> <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2022/country-chapters/cameroon\">civilians</a>\u00a0have been killed by both state security agents and non-state armed groups, with 87,000 refugees in Nigeria, and people 628,000 internally displaced <a href=\"https://reports.unocha.org/en/country/cameroon/\">as of December 2022</a>.\u00a0Arrests related to the conflict took place under the <a href=\"https://www.assnat.cm/gestionLoisLegislatures/libraries/files_upload/uploads/Lois/Penal%20code%20eng%20original.pdf\">penal code</a> punishing alleged acts of secession and terrorism, felony, and territorial integrity.\u00a0The government does not define who a terrorist is, but the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.minjustice.gov.cm/index.php/en/instruments-and-laws/laws/383-law-n-2014-28-of-23-december-2014-of-the-suppression-of-acts-of-terrorism\">anti-terrorism law</a> seems to trap more journalists than terrorists in its net. Arrested journalists are not given the right to a fair trial before an independent and impartial court, but are tried at the military court.</p>\n<h3>Freedom of the press</h3>\n<p>Freedom of the press is enshrined in the preamble of the Cameroon constitution. \u201cThe freedom of communication, of expression, of the press, assembly, association, and trade unionism, as well as the right to strike, shall be guaranteed under conditions fixed by the law.\u201d\u00a0Yet, Cameroon is described as the third worst jailer of <a href=\"https://hrlrc.org/2021/12/11/press-freedom-in-cameroon-top-jailers-of-journalists/\">journalists</a> by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).\u00a0The Cameroon Association of English-Speaking Journalists (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/camasejn?lang=en\">CAMASEJ</a>) <a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/a/cameroon-journalists-decry-separatists-and-military-abuses-on-press-freedom-day-/6555088.html\">said</a> about 80 journalists had fled the two regions, and a total of nine journalists were arrested in 2022.</p>\n<p>The government has been criticized for limiting the freedom of the press and cracking down on journalists and media outlets that are critical of the government. According to the <a href=\"https://rsf.org/en/2021-world-press-freedom-index-journalism-vaccine-against-disinformation-blocked-more-130-countries\">2021 World Press Freedom Index</a>, Cameroon ranks 135th out of 180 countries, which is a decline from its 2020 ranking of 134th. The report notes that journalists in Cameroon face harassment, intimidation, and physical attacks, and that the government has suspended or shut down media outlets that report on sensitive topics or criticize government officials. Additionally, the government has been accused of using the <a href=\"http://www.minjustice.gov.cm/index.php/en/instruments-and-laws/laws/383-law-n-2014-28-of-23-december-2014-of-the-suppression-of-acts-of-terrorism\">December 2014 anti-terrorism law</a> to silence dissent and restrict freedom of expression.</p>\n<p>In 2022, CPJ joined <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AFR1752122022ENGLISH.pdf\">Amnesty\u00a0International</a>\u00a0and 29 other civil society organizations, local and international in a letter demanded that President Biya free persons arrested for exercising their right to freedom of expression, among them journalists Tsi Conrad, Mancho Bibixy, Thomas Awah, and\u00a0 Kingsley Fomunyuy Njoka.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cpj.org/reports/2017/09/journalists-not-terrorists-cameroon-recommendations-anti-terror-imprisoned/\">CPJ argues</a> that journalists are not terrorists, but the government brandishes <a href=\"https://www.businessincameroon.com/politics/2309-9513-mediapart-s-allegations-of-the-existence-of-secret-torture-rooms-at-bir-are-false-says-rene-emmanuel-sadi\">territorial integrity,</a> public peace, and security to justify its actions.

We can focus on both at the same time. Journalists like Lambert Kehven, Samuel Wazizi, and Kingsley Fomunyuy are courageous individuals who brought truth to light, and we should support them in the fight for their cause. The suppression and terror they and others have faced is not a secondary issue but a horrifying reality that demands our immediate attention and response.

Only with a group effort of experts, government official and civilians can we solve this ongoing problem. Does anyone disagree with this approach? Can we all agree on this and find a middle ground together where free speech is protected and disinformation is eliminated?",

The\u00a0<a href=\"https://advox.globalvoices.org/special/unfreedom-monitor/\">Unfreedom Monitor</a> is a Global Voices Advox research initiative examining the growing phenomenon of networked or digital authoritarianism. This extract is of the executive summary of the report on El Salvador, from the series of reports to come out of the research under the Unfreedom Monitor. Read the full report <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Unfreedom_Monitor_El_Salvador_Country_Report_2023.pdf\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<p>When El Salvador ended a civil war (1980\u20131992) through the Peace Accords between the government and the guerrilla movement in 1992, the United Nations presented the country as an example of peace negotiation and conflict resolution around the world. Since the arrival of President Nayib Bukele to power in 2019, El Salvador is becoming a case study for the emergence of a new form of authoritarianism and populism.</p>\n<p>In just three years, Bukele has been able to build a complex political phenomenon that some have called \u201cBukelism,\u201d which entails a mix of a millennial image, promoting the use of Bitcoin as a legal tender in the country, an anti-corruption and anti-traditional political parties narrative, and rhetoric against the United States\u2019s influence on Salvadoran politics. Bukele has quickly moved to create a new political party, Nuevas Ideas, which controls a large majority of the 84 deputies of the Legislative Assembly and the most important local governments in the country. With this support, Bukele promoted a controversial removal of five magistrates of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court and the Attorney General in May 2021. Thus, Bukele controls the executive, legislative, and the crucial Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, which just recently re-interpreted the constitution and allowed the possibility of Bukele\u2019s reelection in 2024.</p>\n<p>Bukele, who did not finish college and worked in the advertising industry before entering politics, has been recognized for his use of social media, especially Twitter, and other platforms to convey a message to his followers. Since he became president, Bukele has used Twitter to communicate orders to public officials, announce the approval of decrees and respond to any event in the country.</p>\n<p>This report analyses two major incidents: the disclosure that Pegasus spyware has been used against journalists from independent media outlets and representatives of civil society, and Bukele\u2019s legal advisor\u2019s threats against two women journalists for not revealing anonymous sources included in a news story. The second event represents a trend of online harassment and threats against women journalists promoted by President Bukele and public officials and replicated by Bukele\u2019s supporters, troll centres, and pro-government influencers on social media.</p>\n<p>Through the analysis of these two main events, this report attempts to respond to the key research question: What are the main motives for, methods of, and responses to digital authoritarianism in El Salvador? Thus, this research identifies the major characteristics, strategies, and narratives interplaying in the configuration of digital authoritarianism in El Salvador. In conclusion, there is substantive evidence that Bukele and Bukelism are constructing a political project based on populism and authoritarian practices, and within this process, one key objective is to discredit the role of independent journalism, and, using spyware technologies such as Pegasus, to legally establish a monitoring system of critical voices and political opponents.</p>\n<p>Consequently, this form of digital authoritarianism not only restricts online and offline freedom of expression in El Salvador but also reflects the dynamics of digital repression and surveillance inspired by other authoritarian regimes around the world.</p>\n<p><em>Read the full report\u00a0<a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Unfreedom_Monitor_El_Salvador_Country_Report_2023.pdf\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<div class=\"factbox\">\n\n<h3>The Unfreedom Monitor</h3>\n<h4>Authoritarian regimes have long had a complicated relationship with media and communications technologies.\u00a0<strong>The Unfreedom Monitor</strong>\u00a0is a Global Voices\u00a0<a href=\"https://advox.globalvoices.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Advox</a>\u00a0research initiative examining the growing phenomenon of networked or digital authoritarianism.</h4>\n<h4><strong><a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Unfreedom_Monitor_El_Salvador_Country_Report_2023.pdf\">Download a PDF of the El Salvador report</a>.</strong></h4>\n</div>\n</div>",

An edited version is</em><em>\u00a0published below as part of a content-sharing agreement</em>.</p>\n<p>North Macedonia will vote on the second round of the presidential elections on Sunday, May 5, amid uncertainties about the turnout and the outcome.</p>\n<p>This is the first presidential elections since the right-wing VMRO-DPNME lost parliament majority in 2016 after ruling for 12 years, and will be the first major test of political support to the government coalition led by the pro-West Social Democratic Party (SDSM).</p>\n<p>The Social Democrat candidate,\u00a0Stevo Pendarovski, barely <a href=\"https://rezultati.sec.mk/mk-MK/1/r\">won the first round with 42.81 percent</a> of the total vote: his main opponent, Gordana Siljanovska Davkova of VMRO-DPMNE, finished with 42.25 percent, a mere 4,486-vote difference.</p>\n<p>This is the <a href=\"https://meta.mk/en/the-first-round-with-the-narrowest-difference-in-the-last-5-elections-infographic/\">narrowest </a>margin between two candidates who went to the second round of the past five presidential elections in North Macedonia.</p>\n<p>Another source of concern is whether the second round will achieve the minimum quorum for the results to be valid. Macedonian law dictates that at least 40 percent of the 1,8-million electorate is required to vote for that to happen. The first round, held on April 21, had a turnout of 41.67 percent, only slightly above that threshold.</p>\n<h3>Albanian votes</h3>\n<p>The third candidate, Blerim Reka, who is ethnic Albanian, finished the first round with 10.6 percent of the vote. The ethnic Albanian community comprises about a quarter of North Macedonia's population and it is widely understood that most of Reka's votes came from citizens of his ethnicity.</p>\n\n<p>The final results will likely be decided by Reka's voters. Many <a href=\"https://civilmedia.mk/albantsite-pokazhaa-deka-znaat-da-izberat-i-pak-ke-izberat-matematichki-pretsizno/\">analysts agree</a> that those votes will most likely go to Pendarovski, as VMRO-DPMNE's platform is largely based on the promotion of ethnic Macedonian nationalism.</p>\n<p>Local journalist Furkan Saliu has been tweeting in both Albanian and Macedonian about the fact that convicted war criminal Johan Tarchulovski, a VMRO-DPMNE MP, has been a part of Siljanovska's campaign.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"und\">Nuk shkon me t\u00eb p\u00ebrkrah edhe shqiptar\u00ebt edhe kriminel i d\u00ebnuar p\u00ebr krime lufte ndaj shqiptar\u00ebve\n\u041d\u0435\u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0434\u0435 \u0434\u0430 \u0442\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0440\u0436\u0438 \u043a\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0446 \u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d \u0437\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0437\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432 \u0410\u043b\u0431\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0442\u0435, \u0438 \u0434\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0448 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u043e\u0434 \u0410\u043b\u0431\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0442\u0435 <a href=\"https://t.co/TpXdCFS6iZ\">pic.twitter.com/TpXdCFS6iZ</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 FurKlan (@FurkanSaliu) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FurkanSaliu/status/1122441243651399681?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 28, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"translation\"><p>Somehow it doesn't seem right to be supported by a criminal convicted of war crimes against Albanians, and asking the Albanians to vote for you.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Message to the government</h3>\n<p>Adding Siljanovska's and Reka's votes, plus the invalid ballots, a total of\u00a0432.000 people didn't vote for the current Social Democratic Party government.</p>\n<p>Prime Minister Zoran Zaev <a href=\"https://tera.mk/%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B5%D0%B2-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B0-%D0%B5-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%82-%D1%98%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%B8-%D1%87/\">stated</a> that the party has understood the people's message. Zaev said the election results means people are unhappy with the poor performance of the lower echelons of his government and announced a \u201cclean-up\u201d of corrupt or incompetent officials.</p>\n\n<p>In a show of support, actor Dragan Spasov, known as Dac, <a href=\"https://tocka.com.mk/vesti/305351/na-zaev-mu-dadoa-metla-steta-sto-ne-znae-da-leta-tviter-zaednicata-so-reakcii-posle-sinokesniot-poteg-na-dac\">gave Zaev a broom as a gift </a>during a public rally.

He has since said that his example of political responsibility should be followed by all officials.</p>\n<p>The government's perception is that there has been some disappointment with recent nepotism scandals when members of parliament and ministers appointed relatives to posts at state-owned companies. On April 25, Zaev <a href=\"https://meta.mk/en/zaev-has-issued-an-order-for-resignations-of-officials-relatives-accused-of-nepotism/\">ordered</a>\u00a0such relatives to resign from their positions.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, officials of the opposition VMRO-DPMNE have an additional interpretation. Its officials <a href=\"https://www.vmro-dpmne.org.mk/2019/04/23/gorchev-graganite-se-genaralno-nezdovolni-od-politikite-na-sdsm-i-na-tsentralno-i-na-lokalno-nivo/\">said</a>\u00a0the election results also convey public dissatisfaction with the Prespa Agreement, which changed the country's name to North Macedonia and ended a 27-year dispute with Greece, and that the VMRO-DPMNE fiercely opposes.</p>\n<p>The agreement led to its signatories, Macedonian Prime Minister Zaev and his Greek counterpart Alexis Tsipiras, to be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Siljanovska has frequently <a href=\"https://kurir.mk/makedonija/vesti/siljanovska-nikogash-nema-da-go-upotrebam-imeto-republika-severna-makedonija/\">stated</a>\u00a0that should she wins, her government will never use the name North Macedonia.</p>\n<p>In turn, Pendarovski has <a href=\"https://www.24.mk/details/pendarovski-glas-za-siljanovska-e-glas-za-gruevski\">said</a> that votes to VMRO-DPMNE are votes to bring back the regime of former Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, sentenced to two years in prison on corruption charges in 2018, now a <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2018/11/16/from-prime-minister-to-escaped-convict-macedonias-ex-leader-nikola-gruevski-flees-to-hungary/\">fugitive in Hungary</a>.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, first and foremost the minimum turnout of 40 percent must be achieved. If that doesn't happen, the election process would have to restart from the beginning, and a new political crisis could follow.</p>\n</div>",

African Americans are said to be \"supportive of their race\" when they vote for candidates that are the same race that they are, but if whites vote for white people then they are seen as \"racist\". I think it is a bit more than just \"voting for someone that is of the same race I am because they know what I go through\" I think if more people were in fact color blind as you said, it would be better, but I think there is a lot of outside forces that make it seem like it is a both sides type issue. That is what seems to be happening here there is one side that is only supported by their own racial similars and a backlash of non-similars instead of looking at policies that would benefit everyone. Hopefully Macedonians and people all over the world can start looking at inclusivity as a norm that all people take part in instead of forcing it from whichever race or creed happens to have a majority in the country.

It is also a temporary home for many migratory birds \u2014 including flamingos. The lake is suitable for incubation and feeding and also allows flamingos to nurse their offspring without threat from predators. The smaller lakes nearby are a source of food and nutrition for these birds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of this, every year in March, thousands of flamingos migrate to the south of Lake Tuz, earning it the moniker \u201cflamingo paradise.\u201d\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://csb.gov.tr/flamingo-nufusu-iki-kat-artti-bakanlik-faaliyetleri-27593\">According to</a> the</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Ministry of Environment and Urbanisation, in 2018 a total of 12,746 flamingos hatched here and by 2019 this number reached 20,381 flamingos.\u00a0Each year, <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-07-18/thousand-of-flamingos-dead-in-drought/100301628\">at least</a> 10,000 flaminglets are born here.\u00a0But this year's migration season faced an unexpected obstacle \u2014 some\u00a05,000 baby flamingos\u00a0were</span><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/turkce/haberler-turkiye-57831306\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0found dead.</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some <a href=\"https://www.dailysabah.com/turkey/mass-flamingo-deaths-grip-drying-turkish-lake/news\">attributed</a> the deaths to a drought that has been plaguing\u00a0Central Anatolia \u2014 a particularly dry area that has been further pressured by global warming.

I am calling on authorities: we should be sensitive to this topic.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Tun\u00e7 <a href=\"https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/investigation-launched-into-mass-flamingo-deaths-in-drying-lake-166345\">described</a> the death of birds a massacre not only for flamingos but other species too.</p>\n</div>",

The increase in demand and the decrease in the cost of renewables will mean that more than half of the region\u2019s total energy output will come from variable renewables by 2050.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">DNV GL\u2019s <a href=\"https://eto.dnvgl.com/2018/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Energy Transition Outlook 2018</a> states that the transition of investment to renewables in the region makes complete sense \u2014 triggered by the falling costs of solar and wind technologies as well as the abundance of sun and wind in the region. Alghoul adds:\u00a0</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThere will be more demand for electricity for cooling buildings and for water desalination, particularly in the desert, and wind and solar have the potential to provide cheaper power. \u2026 And, unlike fossil fuels, these resources will not run out.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">And oil-and-gas-rich countries, such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE have already started investing in renewable energy \u2014 especially solar.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Saudi Arabia, which has the second largest petroleum reserves in the world, is investing in 9.5 gigawatts of solar and wind by 2023, according to DNV GL. Saudi Arabia\u2019s <a href=\"https://vision2030.gov.sa/en/foreword\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Vision 2030</a>\u00a0development plan\u00a0includes a new commitment to renewable energy including 30 percent of its electricity coming from renewables by 2030. Yet, the kingdom's vision has been heavily scrutinized and called<a href=\"https://www.euromoney.com/article/b1bhfrqpcrhyd3/khashoggi-crisis-compounds-bankers-vision-2030-fears\">\u00a0into question</a> in light of the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The UAE, which sits on eight percent of the world\u2019s oil reserves, is also investing heavily in its renewable energy capacities and aims to have 50 percent of its energy from renewables by 2050.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Both oil giants are also encouraging others in the region to develop their renewable energy infrastructure to strengthen energy security and create jobs \u2014 a memorandum was signed in 2017 to develop a grid that interlinks the power supply in the Arab world.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">In fact, according to <a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/is-the-middle-easts-solar-market-breakthrough-finally-happening\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">findings by Greentech Media (GTM),</a> due to the launch of a number of new solar projects in the region, oil prices have dropped to a record low.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Findings from a report by <a href=\"https://www.globaldata.com/store/report/gdae0278vpt--globaldata-power-attractiveness-index/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Global Solar Market Attractiveness Index</a> also predict that Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Oman and Jordan will collectively install more than 22.4 gigawatts capacity in the next four years.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">But despite falling costs, most of the region still awaits solar markets to mature on a commercial level says Abdullah Umer, project manager at King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">A major factor for this could be the distorted energy markets throughout most of the region. Umer states:\u00a0</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Most countries in the region have used their surplus oil production to balance out subsidizing fuel and electricity prices domestically to varying extents for many years with what they claimed were reasons to foster investments and businesses.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">A report by the International Monetary Fund that <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/wp15105.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">analyzed five Middle Eastern markets</a>\u00a0showed that in 2015, fuel subsidies totaled nearly USD $150 billion \u2014 with Saudi Arabia making up nearly 72 percent.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">GTM Research calculates that the average cost of solar PV <a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/global-solar-pv-installations-to-surpass-104-gw-in-2018#gs.WMV1tzOR\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">could be competitive</a> with grid electricity if it wasn't artificially lowered.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">But Umer adds that falling oil prices are making regional oil-producing countries re-evaluate their fuel subsidies \u2014 potentially opening some doors for solar developers.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">And the regional oil-rich nations can look to Jordan when it comes to policies on fostering a solar industry, which, <a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solar-storage-beats-combined-cycle-gas-in-jordan-and-morocco\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">according to GTM</a>, stands out as one of the only countries to have an attractive market for commercial-scale solar.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Jordan passed the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Law in 2012 and has actively been looking toward renewable energy since. Renewable energy projects could make Jordan, a country which is otherwise completely reliant on oil imports for fuel, more energy independent.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The Shams Ma\u2019an plant, built by a U.S.-based solar energy company, First Solar, opened in 2016 and powers 35,000 homes near Petra and the royal palace is also completely powered by a solar plant.</span></p>\n<p>According to Alghoul:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Jordan, unlike most of its neighbors, is supporting its growing solar industry. It has removed fuel subsidies and is providing institutional support to the renewable energy industries through energy transition laws.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Jordan\u2019s national Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Fund also offers debt and equity-based incentives to small to medium scale projects in partnership with six commercial banks. The country has already seen over US $2.5 billion in investment since 2012.</span></p>\n<p>Alghoul predicts:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">If countries remove their subsidies, solar will be allowed to compete in a free market and it will very likely see prices fall.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",

Too often they have seem to be stuck with using oil and other polluting fuels. When I look at the issue I think about my neighbor Paul, he says he knows a lot bout energy technologies. He says that the Middle East should focus entirely on solar power. He does seem to know what he is talking about, so who am I to argue? I can see some people arguing that he doesn't have a degree or is even an expert, but that seems snobbish to me. He uses a lot of words that sound like they could be about energy and he said he watched a tv show about it once. I think that is pretty impressive and his opinion should be respected.",

He said\u00a0during a recent <a href=\"https://www.irrawaddy.com/dateline/dealing-rising-religious-tensions-myanmar.html\">interview by Irrawaddy News Agency</a> that:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I attach greater importance to the moral leadership of political leaders. [\u2026] Frankly speaking, our leaders fail to provide moral leadership. Millions of Rohingya fled and many people died. [\u2026] They should at least acknowledge on humanitarian grounds that they had been living in the country, and are now in trouble after they left the country. Muslims have suffered, and Arakanese people are suffering now, and so are Kachin and Shan people. Only when a leader defines the norms and values of [a] society will people be able to follow. [\u2026] One day when we have leaders who dare to say the country has no place for people with such amoral attitudes, and define clear moral standards for the society, then, hopefully there will be some changes to our society.</p></blockquote>\n</div>",

Ethical standards are formulated in intrinsic valuations contrasted against moral beliefs that are transcendent.

Deep rooted traditional values are signs and guidelines that maintain a natural order of harmony for the over all totality as universal knowledge and style. This is the vitalism that maintains a viability mode of existence for the populace of a territory. However if such transcendental values are held to tightly a stagnation will occur and the populace will begin to experience strife and violence. Open set of moral values must be accommodated for change to allow for what one might define as metabolism or a respiratory system that allows the culture to digest or breath new life in succession.

        "content": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>A new book <a href=\"http://mizzima.com/article/new-book-takes-look-state-myanmar-media\">launched</a> in June 2019 offers a comprehensive discussion about the history and the current state of the media landscape in Myanmar.</p>\n<p>The book, entitled \u201cMyanmar Media in Transition: Legacies, Challenges and Change\u201d was co-edited by Lisa Brooten, Jane Madlyn McElhone, and Gayathry Venkiteswaran. It includes\u00a0<a href=\"http://mizzima.com/article/tracking-media-transition-myanmar\">contributions</a> from Myanmar-based scholars, researchers, members of civil society groups, artists, and journalists who wrote about the impact of the country\u2019s political transition on free expression.</p>\n<p>Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, was <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/dougbandow/2016/03/31/a-brighter-dawn-in-burma-myanmar-not-yet-a-democracy-but-no-longer-a-dictatorship/\">ruled by a junta for several decades</a> until reforms were implemented in 2010, which allowed the restoration of civilian leadership. However, the military has remained dominant in the bureaucracy. In 2015, a national election saw the landslide <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2016/02/02/for-myanmars-people-aung-san-suu-kyis-government-marks-a-new-dawn/\">victory</a> of the former opposition <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_for_Democracy\">National League for Democracy</a> (NLD) headed by Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>\n<p>Gayathry Venkiteswaran, one of the book\u2019s editors, gives a brief overview of the book in an email she wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The book is multidisciplinary and it combines both theoretical and empirical discussions and we have a mix of academics and practitioners who have contributed to the volume. Many of the chapters draw from the work done by civil society groups and other experts on the ground, but we try contextualise these within the history of politics and media in Myanmar and how best we can understand these developments. The volume includes analyses and commentaries about journalism and its challenges, music and film making, the popularity of Facebook and how it affected political discussions and the role it played in the Rakhine crisis, the gaps in the legal frameworks as well as important reflections on the influence of media assistance on the media and civil society in the country.</p></blockquote>\n<p>She mentions the Rakhine crisis which refers to the rise and spread of <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2012/06/16/understanding-the-violence-in-western-myanmar/\">communal violence</a> that has displaced thousands of ethnic Rohingya in northwest Myanmar. She also adds that the work of the book's authors focuses on aspects of the political transition that have not been previously given emphasis in other studies:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Much has been written about the political change since 2010 but this is the first volume focused on media, which goes beyond journalism and includes creative expression as well as digital technology in Myanmar. How the transition or political change will play out is difficult to predict but we felt it was important to document the experiences of change affecting the media and hopefully, this will spark conversations about the future of the industry in the country.</p></blockquote>\n<p>More importantly, she also emphasizes the value of understanding the history of the media, and the role it played in the democratic transition:</p>\n<blockquote><p>On the transition itself, we do challenge assumptions held about the situation in the country. For example, there are many who thought Myanmar did not have independent media or practitioners before the opening, or that media development models in other countries would work in Myanmar. A core thesis of our volume is the need to take a historical and contextual approach to understanding the changes taking place, whether these are positive or negative.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>One of the challenges the editors faced in completing the research was the continued use of junta-era policies and laws by the supposedly reformist NLD-led government to intimidate critics of the military:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There was a lot at stake in terms of the political change and when the NLD government came into power, expectations were high that there would be significant improvements for the media and freedom of expression. But as many of the contributors noted, while the space for expression did open up, the threats against journalists and activists did not reduce. On the contrary, the use of laws, whether <a href=\"https://advox.globalvoices.org/2018/03/21/saynoto66d-documenting-the-surge-of-online-defamation-cases-in-myanmar/\">Section 66(d)</a> of the Telecommunications Law or the Penal Code, Unlawful Associations Act and the Official Secrets Act has shown that the democratically elected government is deploying the same tactics as the previous regime.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This posed a difficulty in gathering sources which also <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2019/05/08/despite-the-release-of-detained-reuters-reporters-free-speech-remains-under-threat-in-myanmar/\">reflects</a> the state of free speech in the country:</p>\n<blockquote><p>While most people were open about their opinions, some were reluctant to identify themselves when interviewed as they were concerned about their own safety. Several contributors note in their chapters how self-censorship and the culture of fear continue to be a problem, especially where criticisms involve the military and even NLD leaders.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The book\u2019s editors acknowledge the need for more research, especially on the ownership of media, and analyses of the Myanmar-language media. Meanwhile, they hope that the book \u201cwill inspire other studies and conversations among stakeholders whether in or outside the country, and contribute towards debates about political transitions and media reforms.\u201d</p>\n<p>The book has already been\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/gayathry/status/1140780609880625152\">launched</a> in Yangon, Myanmar and in Bangkok, Thailand. The book and its selected chapters are <a href=\"https://bookshop.iseas.edu.sg/publication/2387\">available</a> online.</p>\n<div class=\"notes\">This article was amended on 5 August 2019 to mention the correct name for Jane Madlyn McElhone.</div>\n</div>",

I am a software engineer and researcher. I am currently pursuing a Master\u2019s degree in Computer Science at Namibia University of Science and Technology. My research interests are in Computer Vision and natural language processing (NLP).</p>\n<p>I am part of <a href=\"https://www.masakhane.io/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Masakhane</a>, where I am conducting NLP research on low-resource languages, specifically concentrating on my native language Shona. I have been particularly involved in the machine translation and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition\">named-entity recognition</a>\u00a0(NER) initiatives for Shona.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>AOY: What is the current status of your language offline, as well as online?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>BKS</strong>: Shona is very active and vibrant offline. According to the website <a href=\"https://www.mustgo.com/worldlanguages/shona/\">mustgo,</a>\u00a0it is one of the most spoken Bantu languages, with an estimated 10.7 million speakers. It has a rich history and <a href=\"https://www.kwayedza.co.zw/\">literature</a> with a lot of a documentation. Although it has great resources offline, there still a lot potential to increase its presence online.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>AOY: What do you think are the biggest challenges facing your language community with regard to digital communications or creating digital content in their mother language?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>BKS</strong>: I think in most African countries, inclusive of my country, the biggest challenge is that of having the language of the former colonisers as the first language. Although this has been of advantage when communicating on an international stage, it has made our own native languages not be appreciated as they should. This has to some extent made those who speak for example English be thought of as more educated or of a higher social class whilst looking down upon our own native languages. So, you find people preferring the foreign language more than the native one.</p>\n<p>With this, I think the biggest issue which needs to be dealt with is the perspective of the native language, it needs to be shifted to make it more appealing to use whether in business or on the internet, so that people can better embrace it. From a technological standpoint, it is lagging behind in terms of tools and software which make it easier and accessible to use online. This is mostly because of the lack of resources which can be used to produce those tools. Tools and services like dictionaries, translation, keyboards (for languages with diacritics), speech, amongst others, will pay off in the long run as they make it easier to communicate with our own language online.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>AOY: In your opinion, what are some of the steps that could be taken in the short term to encourage increased use of the language on the internet?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>BKS</strong>: I believe the integration of local languages into everyday online tools and technologies that we use can encourage the increased use of the language on the internet. For example, with Google Search, if you could switch the main language to Shona and everything gets displayed in Shona. This should also be the option for social media sites, where most of the languages from Africa are not covered for personalising display language.</p>\n<p>Another example is with Wikipedia. People can contribute pages using their own native languages which in a way increases the discoverability of these languages. I believe another step, as earlier noted, is investment in research and products which utilize native languages.</p>\n<p>From a technological perspective, there is a lot of ground to cover compared to the most widely spoken languages to be at par in terms of research and products. This is an impediment, as we cannot fully express our own language whilst making those unfamiliar with it able to understand it, as the internet has made the world a global village. With these concerted efforts I believe the use of native languages online can be encouraged.</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>AOY: What is your primary motivation for working to see your language and culture available on the internet?</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>BKS</strong>: My motivation is to see a lot of activity when it comes to NLP technologies for Shona, and to have tools that are comparable in performance to the widely adopted languages on the internet. I believe competent tools will inevitably encourage the use of the language on the internet, and for this to happen the native speakers should be at the forefront of researching and producing these tools as they better understand their own language.</p>\n<p>This is why I adore and am part of the Masakhane Community. It is bringing the native speakers to work and research on their own languages. It is lowering the barrier of entry into working with these technologies, providing a community and mentors to help along this journey of producing these tools. In addition to this, it is publishing research which will make it easier for others to continue this work and make sure native languages are represented in technology.</p></blockquote>\n</div>",

The document was leaked online, and this allowed the public to study its content.</p>\n<p>The bill has 76 sections which contain <a href=\"https://www.article19.org/resources/myanmar-scrap-cyber-security-draft-law-and-restore-full-internet-connectivity/\">provisions</a> that empower authorities to order websites to be blocked, content removed, and individuals to be charged for spreading misinformation.</p>\n<p>The bill was presented days after the military staged a <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2021/02/01/what-happened-in-myanmar-on-the-first-day-of-the-coup/\">coup</a>. It is feared that if passed into law, the measure will be used to further <a href=\"https://engagemedia.org/2021/myanmar-digital-rights-democracy/\">stifle</a> free speech in the country.

        "content": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<h4>The Advox Netizen Report offers an international snapshot of challenges, victories, and emerging trends in internet rights around the world.</h4>\n<p>A primary court in Tunis has <a href=\"http://legal-agenda.com/article.php?id=4240\">refused</a> to ban the online radio station Shams Rad, which caters to the \u00a0lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) community, in response to a legal complaint.</p>\n<p>The decision comes despite the fact that same-sex relationships are illegal in Tunisia.</p>\n<p>In a lawsuit filed by a union representing imams (worship leaders at mosques), the group asked the court to request that the Tunisian Internet Agency block access to Shams Rad under the pretext that it threatens \u201csocial and family values.\u201d</p>\n<p>In its February 14 response, the court ruled that the radio station had not violated the rights of others or their reputations, and that the union did not have standing to make such demands.</p>\n<p>When Shams Rad launched in December 2017, its founders received a huge volume of online harassment and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tunisa-gay-radio/tunisias-first-lgbtq-radio-station-keeps-playing-despite-threats-idUSKBN1EL1HB\">threats of violence</a>. As in a majority of Arab region countries, homesexuality is a crime in Tunisia, where it is punishable by up to three years in jail.</p>\n<h3><b>Pakistan\u2019s High Court says mobile shutdowns are illegal. Will other countries follow suit?</b></h3>\n<p>In another judicial victory for free expression, the High Court in Pakistan ruled that mobile network shutdowns as carried out by the Pakistani government <a href=\"https://www.ihrb.org/news-events/news-events/mobile-network-shutdowns-declared-illegal-in-pakistan#.WpQiY0xJgBo.twitter\">are illegal</a>, and contrary to the Pakistan Telecommunication (Re-Organization) Act.</p>\n<p>The ruling raises the question of whether neighboring countries might someday follow their lead. In Bangladesh on February 12, authorities <a href=\"https://advox.globalvoices.org/2018/02/23/laughing-in-the-face-of-an-internet-shutdown-in-bangladesh/\">temporarily shut down</a> mobile internet and throttled broadband speeds during nationwide school exams in an effort to curb attempts at cheating. It then changed course, instead imposing a mobile phone ban near exam halls.</p>\n<h3><b>Slovak web journalist shot dead</b></h3>\n<p>Aktuality.sk reporter Jan Kuciak and his girlfriend Martina Kusnirova were <a href=\"http://europeanjournalists.org/blog/2018/02/26/slovakian-investigative-journalist-jan-kuciak-and-girlfriend-shot-dead/\">found dead</a> on February 25 in their home, about 65 kilometers from the capital Bratislava. A police commander working on the case <a href=\"http://europeanjournalists.org/blog/2018/02/26/slovakian-investigative-journalist-jan-kuciak-and-girlfriend-shot-dead/\">said</a> that the killing was \u201cmost likely related to the investigative work of the journalist.\u201d Kuciak had been working with the <a href=\"https://www.occrp.org/en/amurderedjournalistslastinvestigation/the-model-the-mafia-and-the-murderers\">Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project</a> on an investigation of the Ndrangheta mafia, which the organization describes as \u201cone of the world\u2019s most powerful and fearsome criminal groups.\u201d The group also indicated that Kuciak is the first Slovak journalist ever assassinated in retaliation for his work.</p>\n<h3><b>Indian Facebook users arrested for mocking prime minister, Hindu gods</b></h3>\n<p>Two people <a href=\"https://thewire.in/227684/two-arrested-for-making-derogatory-remarks-against-pm-modi-up-cm-adityanath-and-hindu-gods/\">were arrested in Uttar Pradesh</a>, India, for allegedly making derogatory remarks made against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Hindu gods in a video posted on Facebook and WhatsApp. Authorities say they will be charged under India\u2019s penal code for committing \u201cdeliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion and religious beliefs.\u201d</p>\n<h3><b>Venezuelan man arrested for predicting a power outage via WhatsApp</b></h3>\n<p>The Venezuelan Intelligence Unit (SEBIN) <a href=\"http://talcualdigital.com/index.php/2018/02/15/sebin-detiene-sindicalista-por-alertar-sobre-posible-colapso-electrico/\">arrested unionist</a> and Communist Party of Venezuela member Elio Palacios on February 14, after he used WhatsApp to warn fellow residents of anticipated electricity blackouts. Palacios said the blackouts would likely be a result of negligence and lack of proper maintenance. This contradicts the government\u2019s narrative that blackouts are the result of sabotage by opposition groups.</p>\n<h3><b>Turkey\u2019s parliament to vote on digital media censorship measure</b></h3>\n<p>A parliamentary commission in Turkey has <a href=\"http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/siyaset/920585/internete_buyuk_sansur.html\">approved a bill</a> that would require online broadcasters to be licensed and regulated by federal broadcast media regulator RT\u00dcK. The bill may also extend RT\u00dcK's regulation authority to personal social media accounts, <a href=\"http://bianet.org/bianet/insan-haklari/194062-prof-akdeniz-internet-sansurunde-bir-rtuk-eksikti-o-da-oldu\">raising concerns of political censorship</a> among free speech advocates. The <a href=\"https://cpj.org/2018/02/in-turkey-draft-bill-would-give-new-censorship-pow.php\">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> has strongly condemned the bill.</p>\n<h3><b>S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s mayor is blocking his critics on Facebook. Is that okay?</b></h3>\n<p>Facebook users navigating to the official page of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s city hall are being forced to mind their words or <a href=\"https://advox.globalvoices.org/2018/02/28/sao-paulo-city-halls-official-facebook-page-is-blocking-users-who-criticise-the-mayor/\">face being blocked</a>. According to official government documents obtained by news outlet R7 via an Access to Information request, moderators for the page are actively banning certain terms and blocking users who criticize current Mayor Jo\u00e3o D\u00f3ria. The page is a popular platform for dialogue between the city\u2019s residents and its administration.</p>\n<p>Covering the story for Global Voices, Taisa Sganzerla notes that \u201cwhen a public official blocks users from commenting on their official pages, they effectively censor those users\u2019 voices within a space for civic debate.\u201d</p>\n<h3><b>Cuba censors local online magazine El Estornudo\n</b></h3>\n<p>Cuban authorities <a href=\"https://advox.globalvoices.org/2018/02/28/censored-but-not-backing-down-cuban-news-site-staff-say-they-wont-change-their-editorial-line/\">blocked the website</a> El Estornudo (\u201cThe Sneeze\u201d), adding it to a growing list of media outlets that are censored by state authorities. The site features critical essays on social issues and cultural change, and aims to tell stories of the \u201cother Cuba\u201d that is not part of the official story told by the government. In response, its editors wrote an <a href=\"https://www.revistaelestornudo.com/nota-al-censor-no-puede-leerse-estornudo-cuba/\">open letter</a> to \u201cthe Censor\u201d saying that they would not change their editorial line, despite the block.</p>\n<h3><b>Spanish Instagrammer faces fine for re-mixing image of Jesus</b></h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://advox.globalvoices.org/2018/02/24/photoshopped-image-of-christ-reveals-limits-of-spains-right-to-free-expression/\">Spanish man was fined</a> for superimposing an image of his face over Christ and circulating it on the internet, which prosecutors said showed \u201ca disregard towards and mockery of\u201d a local religious group, which brought the case against the 24-year-old. The decision led to a wave of indignation online, wherein numerous users posted similar images of their own faces superimposed onto that of Jesus. Supporters also raised money to pay for the fine, which the man says would have cost him 10 days\u2019 worth of wages.</p>\n<h3><b>Minority Reporting: Predictive policing in China and the US</b></h3>\n<p>A new <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/02/26/china-big-data-fuels-crackdown-minority-region\">report by Human Rights Watch</a> sheds light on the magnitude of China\u2019s predictive policing surveillance infrastructure in the western Xinjiang region, where the population is largely comprises Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities. Using a combination of CCTV facial recognition technology, <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2017/07/19/chinas-xinjiang-residents-are-being-forced-to-install-surveillance-apps-on-mobile-phones/\">mobile phone surveillance software</a>, national ID systems and physical surveillance, police now routinely aggregate and cross-reference data about citizens\u2019 activities, movements, financial transactions and a host of other points as part of China\u2019s \u201cStrike Hard Campaign,\u201d which claims to target violent activities and terrorism.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile in the US, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2018/2/27/17054740/palantir-predictive-policing-tool-new-orleans-nopd#click=https://t.co/kZyY8kaMQv\">The Verge published</a> new findings that the New Orleans police department used predictive policing software developed by Silicon Valley firm Palantir in order to track the identities and activities of gang members in the southern US city, without the knowledge of local city councillors.</p>\n<p>According to the tech news site, the software \u201ctraced people\u2019s ties to other gang members, outlined criminal histories, analyzed social media, and predicted the likelihood that individuals would commit violence or become a victim.\u201d This information escaped the scrutiny of civilian government officials because the software was given to police as part of a \u201cphilanthropic\u201d relationship between the department and the company.</p>\n<h3><b>New Research</b></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.article19.org/resources/apps-arrests-abuse-egypt-lebanon-iran/\">Apps, arrests and abuse in Egypt, Lebanon and Iran: An investigation into use of social and dating apps by LGBTQ communities</a> \u2013 Article 19</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/files/2018/02/15/face-off-report-1b.pdf\">Face Off: Law Enforcement Use of Facial Recognition Technology</a> \u2013 Jennifer Lynch, Electronic Frontier Foundation</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ipysvenezuela.org/2018/02/27/navegacion-la-minima-expresion-condiciones-la-calidad-internet-venezuela/\">Navegaci\u00f3n a la m\u00ednima expresi\u00f3n: Condiciones de la calidad de internet en Venezuela</a> \u2013 Instituto Prensa y Sociedad de Venezuela</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thenetmonitor.org/bulletins/the-yemen-war-online-propagation-of-censored-content-on-twitter\">The Yemen War Online: Propagation of Censored Content on Twitter</a> \u2013 Internet Monitor, Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/Y-f11\"><b>Subscribe to the Netizen Report</b></a></h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"factbox\">\n<p><a href=\"https://advox.globalvoices.org/author/afef-abrougui/\">Afef Abrougui</a>, <a href=\"https://advox.globalvoices.org/author/ellery-roberts-biddle/\">Ellery Roberts Biddle</a>, <a href=\"https://advox.globalvoices.org/author/marianne-diaz/\">Marianne Diaz</a>, <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/author/rohithjyothish/\">Rohith Jyothish</a>, <a href=\"https://advox.globalvoices.org/author/lauravidal/\">Laura Vidal</a> and<a href=\"https://advox.globalvoices.org/author/sarahbmyers/\"> Sarah Myers West</a> contributed to this report.</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

Gambian President Adam Barrow <a href=\"http://www.kerr-fatou.com/gambias-president-misses-ecowas-summit-due-to-internet-outage/\"><span class=\"s3\">was notably absent from an online Economic Community of West African States meeting due to an internet outage.</span></a>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Ebrima Sillah, Minister of Information and Communication, insisted that the 2019 outage was not deliberate, <a href=\"https://www.freedomnewspaper.com/2021/02/09/the-country-has-suffered-a-lot-of-financial-loss-because-of-the-internet-and-voice-for-international-calls-outage-information-minister-sillah-declares/\">confirming</a> that the cable link connecting the African coast to Europe (ACE) was cut at sea level.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">And the most recent shutdown had to do with a \u201cpower outage in the Senegal base Sonatel station that hosts the connectivity between the Gambia and Senegal, via the ACE cable,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.gm/gambia-hit-with-a-general-internet-blackout-for-12-hours/\"><span class=\"s1\">according to The Chronicle.</span></a></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">But \u201cthe overlap of the disruptions with <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gambia-politics/protests-against-gambia-president-bring-137-arrests-multiple-injuries-idUSKBN1ZQ19G\"><span class=\"s1\">anti-government protests </span></a>prompted suspicion of government involvement,\u201d according to the 2020 Freedom House report.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Gambians have taken to social media \u2014\u00a0especially Facebook and Twitter \u2014 to express their frustration.</p>\n<p>Demba Kandeh wrote that an \u201cinternet connection [is] no longer a luxury, it is a necessity.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">The Gambia experienced the second internet outage in 2021 and it is still January.

Gambians who live abroad rely on The Fatu Network and other online outlets for news and information on Gambia. A day without the internet means wading in the dark for most of these people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p2\">Like in many other countries, a lot of learning in the Gambia is now conducted online due to the pandemic.</p>\n<p>Muhammed L. Darboe tweeted how, as a student, the outages are a major distraction:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">The distracting thought that echoes in my mind every time I take an online exam is I could receive an SMS from my provider that \u201cwe are experiencing a nationwide internet outage, sorry for the inconveniences caused\u201d. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gambia?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Gambia</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Muhammed L. Darboe (@Nrs_MLDabo) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nrs_MLDabo/status/1365547543682289665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 27, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n<p class=\"p2\">Mamud Joof, a student at the University of the Gambia, told Global Voices that a lack of internet services affects him greatly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cI cannot have access to my student portal to do my assignments or check new course updates.\u00a0 \u2026 It further limits my research, which affects my output and understanding of the courses I do. As a student, internet outage in this pandemic basically halts all my activities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p2\">The government launched the country\u2019s first internet exchange point (IXP) in July 2014, to boost speed and security of internet services across the country, though the IXP runs slowly,\u201d according to the 2020 Freedom House report.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\">A widening digital divide</h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">Gambians face immense challenges with internet access due to expensive data. Today, data can go for up to 10,000 dalasis or $200 United States dollars per month to enjoy a high-speed internet connection, depending on the provider.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">In fact, \u201chigh cost remains a primary hindrance to internet access in the Gambia, where 48.6 percent of individuals live in poverty,\u201d <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/country/gambia-the\"><span class=\"s1\">according to 2015 World Bank data provided by Freedom House</span></a>.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">There's a wide range of internet service providers in the country, but state-owned <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/gambia/freedom-net/2019#footnote4_sq9j844\"><span class=\"s1\">Gamtel has a monopoly on the internet gateway,</span></a>\u00a0limiting the market's potential for competitive rates.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Journalist Momodou Gajaga told Global Voices that he spends about 15 percent of his salary \u2014 about $50 United States dollars per month \u2014 on internet fees and services:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p2\">As someone who lives from paycheck to\u00a0 paycheck, spending this sum on the internet is a huge burden considering my commitments to provide other basic needs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p2\">And Samba Jallow, a final year physics major at the University of the Gambia, told Global Voices:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cThe digital divide in the country is seriously affecting us, as it\u2019s near impossible for many students at the University of the Gambia to keep up with the high data cost maintenance needed to actively attend lectures online. One gigabyte of internet data costs $5 [United States] dollars whilst the average Gambia earns less than a dollar a day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p2\">Most service providers in the Gambia have not prioritized investments in network coverage in rural areas, according to the 2020 Freedom House report.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Hatab Hydara, a manager of a community library in rural Gambia, told Global Voices:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p2\">Our children couldn\u2019t get to school or access learning materials online due to the lack of and poor digital infrastructure in the country. Our children in the rural areas had to stay home for months missing out whilst only few private schools in the urban areas were able to afford the high cost of internet and materials for their children to continue having lessons online.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p2\">Gambian rapper ST-Brikama Boyo calls attention to the unfair digital divide in the Gambia with his hit song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzZ3Bl_yN2Y\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cMy People,\u201d</span></a>\u00a0 in collaboration with Grammy winner Baaba Maal. In the song, he sings, \u201c[Internet] connection slow but internet is very expensive for my people.\u2019\u2019 The song garnered more than 100,000 views in 48 hours.</p>\n\n<p class=\"p2\">The government has identified <a href=\"https://www.budde.com.au/Research/Gambia-Telecoms-Mobile-and-Broadband-Statistics-and-Analyses\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cclosing the digital divide\u201d</span></a> as part of its National Broadband Network project, yet progress since 2019 has been limited.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\">Urgent need for digital rights reform</h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">In November 2019, when the Gambia drafted a new constitution that later dead-ended in parliament, internet connectivity was not mentioned, even though many countries now consider it a necessity alongside water and electricity.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Give1Project Gambia, a nongovernmental organization, has been raising awareness about digital rights in the Gambia for the past several years.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">During the constitutional review process, <a href=\"https://trumpet.gm/2020/02/03/give-1-gambia-chapter-holds-a-day-long-consultation-on-access-to-information-bill/\">Give1Project</a> was the only organization to submit a position paper on digital rights. The paper included a demand to provide equal access to technology and communications to all citizens, including marginalized groups, by removing barriers to access and improving affordability, as well as expanding infrastructure and preventing internet disruptions.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Alieu Sowe, Give1Project\u2019s country director, told Global Voices that digital rights are not protected in the Gambia:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p2\">\u00a0The Gambia still has a lot of ambiguous laws in the 1997 constitution which the authorities can use to infringe on the rights of Gambians, [and] due to these draconian laws, digital rights of Gambians are not protected.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p2\">He further called on the government to limit economic barriers to ensure access and introduce rights policies and laws to support these efforts.</p>\n<div class=\"factbox\">\n<h5>Read more:\u00a0<a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2021/03/31/the-gambias-missed-opportunity-for-digital-rights-reform/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"The Gambia\u2019s missed opportunity for digital rights reform\">The Gambia\u2019s missed opportunity for digital rights reform</a></h5>\n</div>\n<p class=\"p2\">Under former dictator Yahya Jammeh \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/tag/yahya-jammeh\">accused of human rights abuses including rape and torture</a> \u2014\u00a0many organizations and activist groups relied on the internet to communicate and connect with citizens. This led to an increase in the number of online media outlets leveraging technology to advocate for change.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">When President Adama Barrow was elected in 2016, he applauded <a href=\"http://worldpolicy.org/2016/12/09/gambia-social-media-overwhelms-a-20-year-dictator/\">online media for supporting his agenda</a> that led to his eventual victory.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Yet, to this day, the Gambia has not yet sufficiently solved its infrastructure challenges to solve these issues \u2014\u00a0stalling potential development and growth.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">Ahead of an <a href=\"https://africa.cgtn.com/2020/07/16/gambias-electoral-commission-announces-2021-presidential-election-date/\"><span class=\"s1\">election year</span></a> in the Gambia, internet instability also poses serious risks because it may disrupt online political campaign activities.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">The internet is essential to the Gambia\u2019s development. Digital rights activists must fight for the right to free and fair access to internet services.</p>\n</div>",

The government can improve it's internet exchange point which will add additional connection speed to its citizens, also it can open the market to allow more competition.

        "content": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>Almost two years after the <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/special/myanmar-coup-2021/\">coup</a> led by military commander-in-chief Senior General Min Aung Hlainge, internet shutdowns, restrictions, and interruptions continue in most parts of Myanmar. The junta has imposed targeted internet shutdowns in regions where the military faces strong resistance from armed resistance groups accompanied by severe offline crackdowns. A <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/06/myanmar-un-experts-condemn-militarys-digital-dictatorship\">press statement</a> released by the United Nations on June 7, 2022, reported that 31 townships in seven states and regions of Myanmar have been experiencing a complete internet shutdown since August 2021, and a further 23 townships have experienced internet throttling.<a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/myanmar/freedom-net/2022\"> According to Freedom House</a>, cuts were reported in the Yangon Region, Mandalay Region, Chin State, Magway Region, and Tanintharyi Region, which affected millions of internet users. The internet cut in Sagaing Region, where armed fighting between Myanmar's junta troops and resistance forces was happening, was particularly severe.</p>\n<p>This repressive tactic of internet shutdown and throttling is not new to the military playbook \u2014 <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/myanmar/freedom-net/2022\">they used it in June 2019</a>, before the coup, in the conflict-affected areas of Rakhine and Chin states in an attempt to cover up human rights violations and atrocities committed by the military security forces against the Rohingya ethnic group. The internet shutdown was described as the <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2019/12/29/longest-internet-disruption-in-myanmars-rakhine-state-sets-dangerous-precedent/\">longest internet shutdown</a> in the world, lasting two years and <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2020/04/06/blocked-websites-internet-shutdown-and-media-arrests-undermine-free-speech-in-myanmar/\">affecting</a> <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2020/06/26/activists-demand-end-to-year-long-internet-disruption-in-myanmars-rakhine-and-chin-states/\">1.4 million people</a> living in the conflict zones. During that time, the military claimed that connectivity disruption was imposed in order to <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/myanmar/freedom-net/2022\">\u201cmaintain stability, and law and order\u201d until the \u201csecurity situation\u201d</a> improved again in those conflict-affected areas. The authorities also justified shutdowns as combating \u201c<a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-end-internet-shutdown-rakhine-chin-states\">disturbances of the peace and use of internet services to coordinate illegal activities.</a>\u201d Amnesty International <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-end-internet-shutdown-rakhine-chin-states\">documented</a>\u00a0serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law committed by the Myanmar military security forces, including unlawful and indiscriminate attacks that led to the killing and injury of unarmed civilians, torture, extrajudicial execution, <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/special-procedures/wg-disappearances/about-enforced-disappearance#:~:text=An%20enforced%20disappearance%20is%20considered,deprivation%20of%20liberty%20or%20by\">enforced disappearances</a>, forced labor, and more, in places that faced internet and communication blackouts. In the post-coup context, the military's strategy of cutting off the internet and telecommunications in the name of \u201cpublic security\u201d continues to be a practice and pattern in resistance stronghold regions where \u201cclearance operations\u201d are launched.</p>\n<p>On March 3, 2022, the military junta-controlled Ministry of Transport and Communications <a href=\"https://myanmar-now.org/en/news/myanmar-junta-cuts-off-internet-access-indefinitely-to-resistance-stronghold-of-sagaing\">issued an order</a> to indefinitely cut off internet access in most parts of the Sagaing region, except the four urban areas. This internet shutdown and throttling followed an escalation of military offensives and raids on villages, which frequently included the killing of civilians, burning of houses and farms, and other human rights violations. Out of 34 townships in Sagaing, eight were facing regular internet blackouts, while the other townships had access only to 2G connections. It was <a href=\"https://www.ispmyanmar.com/more-than-22000-homes-and-buildings-torched-after-the-coup/\">documented</a> that 15,530 houses were torched or destroyed in villages within 28 townships (a district-type division in Myanmar) of Sagaing region between February 1, 2021, and May 26, 2022, while a total of 22,299 homes or buildings were destroyed across the country.</p>\n<p>Similarly, in the Hpakant township of Kachin State, the junta cut off internet access in August 2021 in order to launch a military offensive in the area in response to the attacks of the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) and the local People's Defence Force (PDF). Shortly after, internet blackouts \u2014 including cut off of mobile internet and Wifi-services \u2014 continued to be enforced in another 11 townships in northwestern Myanmar. As reported by <a href=\"https://myanmar-now.org/en/news/military-cuts-off-internet-connection-in-11-more-townships-in-northwestern-myanmar?page=47&amp;width=500&amp;height=500&amp;inline=true\">Myanmar Now</a>, the affected townships include Gangaw, Htilin, and Myaing in Magway region, and Falam, Kanpetlet, Matupi, Mindat, Paletwa, Tedim, Thantlang, and Tonzang in Chin State. At 8:30 p.m. on October 23, 2022, <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/over-80-killed-airstrike-concert-hpakant-myanmar-24-oct\">Myanmar military jets attacked</a> Kansi village in Hpakant township of Kachin State, which killed at least 80 people, including singers and musicians who were attending an anniversary celebration of the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO). The airstrike also injured about 100 people who were attending the outdoor concert. It was reported that the military junta also blocked road access in order to bar humanitarian aid and relief groups from reaching the impact site to deliver lifesaving assistance. With the deliberate communications blackout, local media could only receive information about this massacre many hours later and reported about it on October 24.</p>\n<p>The internet blackout has made it difficult for locals to both send and receive information on the conditions in the region, report human rights abuses committed by the military regime, raise funds for humanitarian business, spread information about the movement of military forces, and access education, health, livelihood, and other basic needs. In conflict-affected areas, online access to information <a href=\"https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/2403331/in-myanmar-internet-can-mean-life-or-death\">can mean the difference between life and death</a>. The internet blackout has reportedly stopped people from fleeing army raids as warnings of impending raids could not be shared via the telecommunication channels such as Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp, which people in Myanmar often find more secure than talking on their mobile phones. <a href=\"https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/internet-09282022162550.html\">In a Radio Free Asia interview</a>, residents of Hnan Khar village of Gangaw township, Magway division, regarding the internet shutdown in the area stated, \u201cAs there was no flow of information, the people couldn't be warned [ahead of the raids] and were caught off guard, arrested, tortured and killed. We saw junta soldiers do whatever they pleased \u2014 killing people and burning down villages.\u201d</p>\n<p>Furthermore, they added that there is no way to send out evidence such as photos and video of human rights abuses and war crimes committed by military troops because there is no internet in most places where clashes are ongoing.\u00a0 As mobile payment services are also being restricted or cut off, it is becoming impossible to raise donations or transfer or receive funds. Since little information gets out from conflict-affected areas, little is known about the on-the-ground situation. With the junta-enforced communication blackout, it has become more challenging for humanitarian actors to gather evidence of human rights violations, monitor the humanitarian crisis and deliver aid, and for journalists to report about incidents and political developments from those areas in a timely manner.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-update-no-24-3-december-2022\">The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) reported</a> that as of the end of 2022, more than 1.4 million people remained displaced across Myanmar as a result of insecurity and violence, of which 1.1 million people were displaced as the result of the military coup. It further reported that humanitarian and protection needs are mounting, but the humanitarian response as of now is underfunded by only 28 percent. Just like access to food, shelter, health care, and education, access to information and communication is a basic need and it is a fundamental human right. While internet shutdowns in conflict-affected areas of the country continue to be a critical issue, despite the work of <a href=\"https://myanmarinternet.info/\">civil society groups</a> and <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2021/06/28/myanmar-journalists-endure-attacks-for-reporting-the-coup/\">independent media</a> to sustain awareness about the situation, very little has been done by the United Nations, international associations, or communities to restore internet access for displaced people and those living in conflict-affected areas of Myanmar.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Please visit the project page for more pieces from the\u00a0<a href=\"https://advox.globalvoices.org/special/unfreedom-monitor/\">Unfreedom Monitor</a>.</h3>\n\n</div>",

If we allow the silence of the victims of this coup then we will never know the truth of what is actually happening, that is simply not acceptable.

        "content": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>Thousands of Hong Kongers attended a candlelight vigil to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Massacre at Victoria Park on Tuesday night. This collective act of remembrance has turned into a ritual for the past 30 years, as many Hong Kongers keep honoring the spirit of China's democratization, as well as the high price some paid for it on June 4, 1989.</p>\n<p>The Chinese government continues to claim that the democracy movement led by students in Beijing in 1989 was a riot manipulated by foreign forces. The 50 day-long peaceful protest ended with a military crackdown on June 4, 1989. According to a Chinese Red Cross estimate, 2,700 civilians were killed, but other sources point to a much higher toll. A confidential U.S government document <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/tiananmen-square-massacre-death-toll-secret-cable-british-ambassador-1989-alan-donald-a8126461.html\">unveiled in 2014</a> reported that a Chinese internal assessment estimated at least 10,454 civilians had been killed.</p>\n<p>Within China, the June 4 incident, as it is described, has been a political taboo for 30 years. The majority of the young generation has never heard about the military crackdown, as it has not been reported on in newspapers. Similarly, online discussions about the events have been and remain censored. This year, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) affiliated news outlet Global Times\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1152903.shtml\">described</a> such censorship practice as a \u201cpolitical success\u201d, as it has turned the June 4 incident into \u201ca faded historical event rather than an actual entanglement\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>Hong Kong has been the most significant site within China in preserving the memories of June 4. The organizer of the annual candlelight vigil, the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movement in China, has also\u00a0<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_4th_Museum\">established a June 4 Museum</a> in the city in 2014.</p>\n<p>Every year, the organizer also provides an update on the actual documentation of the victims of the Tiananmen Massacre, given that the Chinese government blocks any inquiries.

Since the incident, China has successfully become the world's second largest economy, with rapid improvement of people's living standards. The policy of avoiding arguing has served as a contributor to the country's economic take-off.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In such political context, the people\u2019s memory of June 4 has become a \u201ccrime\u201d, as depicted by lyrics of the song, <a href=\"https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/05/23/memory-is-a-crime-hong-kong-singer-anthony-wong-pens-new-song-to-commemorate-tiananmen-massacre/\"><em>Memory is a crime</em></a> composed by local pop singer Anthony Wong to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Massacre.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u56de\u61b6\u5373\u4f7f\u6709\u7f6a\n\u771f\u76f8\u600e\u9ebc\u6562\u7121\u8a00\n\u6b77\u53f2\u5047\u4f7f\u6709\u4eba\u5b9a\u88ab\u767c\u73fe</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"translation\"><p>Even though it is a crime to remember\nThe truth will find its courage to be told\nThe history that has happened will be revealed</p></blockquote>\n<p>Anthony Wong performed on stage during the candle vigil and urged the people of Hong Kong to speak up against the <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2019/04/02/hong-kong-rallies-against-amendment-allowing-extradition-of-fugitives-to-china/\">amendment of the city's extradition law</a> and to join an upcoming protest on June 9.</p>\n\n<p>The spirit and the courage to remember are well preserved by the sea of candlelight.

        "content": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p><em>The following post is originally written by Kris Cheng and published by Hong Kong Free Press <a href=\"https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/05/12/tiananmen-massacre-30-years-survivor-qa-zhou-fengsuo/\">on 12 May 2019</a>. The edited version is republished on Global Voices under a content partnership agreement.</em></p>\n<p>Ahead of the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Massacre, HKFP asked several survivors of the crackdown to answer a set of questions about the tragedy and share their views on China\u2019s future.</p>\n<p>The 1989 massacre ended months of student-led demonstrations in China as the military was deployed to suppress protesters in Beijing. It is estimated that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people died.</p>\n<p>Zhou Fengsuo was a fourth-year physics student at Tsinghua University in 1989 who became a student leader of the Beijing Autonomous University Students Union during the movement. He now lives in the US and HKFP last spoke to him in 2014 when he <a href=\"http://hongwrong.com/fengsuo-zhou/\">visited Hong Kong</a> during the Umbrella Movement protests. Zhou had previously worked in finance and currently serves as president of the group, Humanitarian China.</p>\n<p><strong>HKFP: It is becoming more and more difficult to demand responsibility for June 4th. Do you still have any hope?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Zhou Fengsuo:</strong> The Chinese Communist Party must bear responsibility, this is the most important thing. Those directly responsible were, of course, the families of ex-Chinese leaders Deng Xiaoping and Li Peng.</p>\n<p>We have our views on how to seek responsibility \u2013 in my view, if a democratic government seeks responsibility from them, the wealth of the two families must be taken away, including their next generations.</p>\n<p>To seek responsibility is to seek justice, and the beginning of that is to find the truth. For example, how did they decide how to kill people? Why did they kill people? Truth is important for finding out who is responsible.</p>\n<p>It is a very big problem in China that people who committed these evil acts did not take any responsibility. We have to make an example of those who committed evil acts \u2013 regardless of where they went \u2013 we must seek responsibility.</p>\n<p>We have evidence that clearly points to the families of Deng Xiaoping and Li Peng. Some have proposed placing two kneeling statues at the <a href=\"https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/02/25/worlds-largest-monument-1989-tiananmen-massacre-unveiled-ahead-30th-anniversary/\">Liberty Sculpture Park [in the US] close to the June 4 monument</a>. This is what we can do on the civil side.</p>\n<p><strong>HKFP: Is there any particular experience you recall vividly after leaving China?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Zhou Fengsuo:\u00a0</strong>I was jailed for a year after 1989. I was in exile in Yangyuan County in Hebei Province. I left China in early 1995.</p>\n<p>I fought for my opportunity to leave China. I went through a long process \u2013 I earned a scholarship to study physics [at a US university] but I was not given a passport. I protested and marched and fought for my passport.</p>\n\n<p><strong>HKFP: Some 1989 activists are still in China. Are you concerned about their condition? What can be done for them?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Zhou Fengsuo:\u00a0</strong>Humanitarian China [a group Zhou co-founded] has been helping them by providing financial assistance, getting information about their situations and advocating for them. They include the Tiananmen Mothers, [Chinese] residents who were against the violent crackdown, and wanted students. We have been helping them in all kinds of ways.</p>\n<p>Many are under oppression because of the 1989 protests and the commemorations afterward. They include the <a href=\"https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/04/04/hongkongers-protest-beijings-jailing-activists-made-tiananmen-massacre-alcohol-label/\">'89 alcohol bottle case</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/poster-06122018105644.html\">Zeng Guofan</a> of Jiangxi Province who was arrested last year for commemorating June 4 \u2013 these are the people we are concerned about.</p>\n<p>The most important thing is that we need more people to talk about their stories. The authorities were very barbaric in these cases, and there weren't many people in China who would speak out for them.</p>\n<p>They also include Professor <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/world/asia/chinese-law-professor-xi.html\">Xu Zhangrun</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2004/03/dr-jiang-yanyongs-letter-calling-for-june-4-reappraisal/\">Jiang Yanyong</a> \u2013 we need to care about them. Many people have sacrificed their freedom. <a href=\"https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/auction-09172018113425.html\">Liu Xianbin</a> was jailed for more than 20 years in 1989. We need to pay attention to them because the Chinese Communist Party hopes that they will be forgotten after 30 years.</p>\n<p><strong>HKFP: 30 years have passed and many relatives and parents of the victims have passed away. Do you regret being unable to visit your family for decades?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Zhou Fengsuo:\u00a0</strong>I have no regrets about not being able to go home to visit my family. I have talked about it many times \u2013 the Communist Party wanted me to come back and make a fortune. But I said, if I come back, I will not visit my family, I will not do business. I will talk about June 4 for my whole life anywhere, and it will be my top priority when I return to China.</p>\n<p>The work I do overseas will continue in China. I don\u2019t really like the sentimentality of the subject of returning home. This is something that the Chinese Communist Party has exploited. It wanted to make coming home a sentimental thing \u2013 this is not acceptable. If I come back, I will do everything to overthrow this regime, I have said this many times.</p>\n<p><strong>HKFP: After 30 years of huge changes, where do you see China going in the future? Do you see any hope that it will turn out better politically?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Zhou Fengsuo:\u00a0</strong>To tolerate the existence of the Chinese Communist Party is not only dangerous to Han people in China but to people in Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Macau and the whole world.</p>\n<p>This is the reality we are facing. We allowed this regime \u2013 which killed people using tanks in 1989 \u2013 to continue to exist, the US did business with it. It was \u2013 and is \u2013 the shame of the international community.</p>\n<p>We will never reconcile, we must fully resist.</p>\n<p><strong>HKFP: In terms of recent developments in China, two of them are particularly alarming: The crackdown on lawyers and the phenomena of forced confessions. How do you see these developments?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Zhou Fengsuo:\u00a0</strong>We cannot be optimistic about China\u2019s situation. The madness of Xi Jinping has its own basis in Chinese society, namely the middle class pretending to be ignorant and the young generation who are being brainwashed.</p>\n<p>This is very scary for a country\u2019s future and a great challenge to the world\u2019s development of peace. Xi Jinping\u2019s madness and stupidity is a representation of this country. China will have to pay a heavy price for it in the future.</p>\n<p>I believe that forces pushing for change inside China \u2013 bottom-up or top-down \u2013 were almost non-existent. It may likely be the case that we need to force China to change through the confrontation between countries.</p>\n<p>But our principles won\u2019t change, regardless of whether China will change. We demand a regime which has respect for freedom, dignity, and life. Regardless of how dark the situation is right now, we will persist.</p>\n</div>",

        "content": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>On June 30, 2020, the day the National Security Law in Hong Kong was enacted, the local government gave <a href=\"https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/06/20200630/20200630_172344_900.html\">reassurances</a> that \u201cit will not affect legitimate rights and freedoms of individuals.\u201d Two years later, however, drastic changes in the local media landscape tell a different story.</p>\n<p>Not long ago, dissenting voices were part of Hong Kong\u2019s public discourse. The framework of \u201cOne Country, Two Systems,\u201d which promised the city a high degree of autonomy after 1997, was also seen as a recognition that Hong Kong\u2019s previous success as a global financial centre was rooted in the far-reaching freedoms of individuals and businesses. Political screening was largely non-existent. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/oct/31/a-chapter-closes-last-hong-kong-bookshop-selling-titles-banned-in-china-shuts\">Book shops</a>, many widely frequented by visitors from the Chinese mainland, could legally sell controversial titles, while artists and filmmakers could get <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/04/02/hong-kong-china-ten-years-movie/\">support and exposure</a> without the need to compromise their political messages.</p>\n<p>However, following the social unrest in 2019, China\u2019s central government inserted the national security law (NSL), passed by the standing committee of the National People\u2019s Congress into Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the so-called Basic Law, putting an end to a nearly two-decades-long hands-off approach to the controversial issue of national security. Circumventing the local legislature, the new National Security Law was introduced within days, with many <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-52765838\">details unknown</a> until the legislation was passed. While the law was not meant to be applied retroactively, initial <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/chinas-vague-national-security-law-sparks-international-concerns-for-hong-kong/a-54042167\">concerns</a> were raised over its vagueness and broadness \u2014 especially how those undefined \u201cred lines\u201d would affect the work of journalists. But authorities largely dismissed such concerns by emphasising that the law would only affect \u201c<a href=\"https://hongkongfp.com/2021/10/04/new-hong-kong-security-law-article-23-will-only-affect-a-small-group-of-people-says-top-official/\">a small group of people</a>,\u201d yet the tally of disappeared media organisations suggests otherwise.</p>\n<h3>\u201cSelf-inflicted\u201d closure of critical media</h3>\n<p>The first major casualty was the popular tabloid Apple Daily which published a daily print newspaper and operated an elaborate online news site with additional content for paid subscribers. While Apple Daily was well known for its <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/06/hong-kong-apple-daily/619278/\">sensationalist journalism</a>, it was also closely aligned with the so-called pan-democratic camp, a political alliance of pro-democracy parties and activists. On June 17, 2021, the Hong Kong Police Force raided the headquarters of the newspaper and arrested five affiliates. Meanwhile, most of Apple Daily\u2019s financial assets and bank accounts were frozen, forcing the newspaper to shut down only a few days later. The last issue, which was printed one million times (compared to the usual 80,000 daily copies) was sold out within hours of publication, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/24/hong-kong-apple-daily-queue-final-edition-newspaper\">many citizens</a> lining up late at night to get a copy. Founder Jimmy Lai has since been <a href=\"https://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news/section/4/193574/Jimmy-Lai-and-47-democrats-charged-under-NSL-to-face-trial-with-no-jury\">charged</a> under the National Security Law, with the trial scheduled to start in the near future.</p>\n<p>After the closure of Apple Daily, Stand News, a popular online news media outlet, was widely regarded as the most important pro-democracy outlet in the city. It was founded in 2014, succeeding the previously popular platform House News. On June 27, 2021, Stand News announced that it would <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2021/06/29/hong-kong-digital-news-outlet-stand-news-removes-articles-and-suspends-subscriptions-following-apple-daily-closure/\">remove</a> previously published articles from its platforms and also stop paid subscriptions in the hope of avoiding a similar fate as Apple Daily. Six months later, their office was raided by the Hong Kong Police Force, with two senior editors later being charged with publishing seditious materials. Editor Ronson Chan, who is the chairman of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, has also been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/29/hong-kong-police-arrest-six-journalists-from-independent-media-outlet-stand-news\">investigated</a>. Shortly after the raid, the media outlet <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/28/media/hong-kong-media-stand-arrests-intl-hnk/index.html\">announced</a> the voluntary closure to protect its staff.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Stand News ex-Chief editor Chung Pui Kuen<a href=\"https://hongkongfp.com/2023/04/04/stand-news-sedition-trial-testimony-of-ex-chief-editor-ends-after-36-days-as-closing-arguments-set-for-june/\"> has completed</a> his testimony in court over 17 allegedly \u201cseditious\u201d articles, which are commentaries, reports and images that are critical of the Hong Kong and Beijing governments, such as interviews with activists running for the pro-democracy primaries and criticisms that a mere slogan like \u201cend one-party dictatorship\u201d<a href=\"https://hongkongfp.com/2023/03/07/stand-news-sedition-trial-hong-kong-court-hears-debate-on-if-calling-for-end-to-chinas-one-party-rule-is-lawful/\"> could fall</a> into the remit of \u201cinciting subversion\u201d under the NSL. The closing argument of the trial will take place in June, and the case will be a landmark regarding how freedom of speech has changed in Hong Kong under the national security regime.</p>\n<p>The disappearance of another major online medium was seen as a warning for the industry at large. In the following days, several other platforms ceased their operations, citing the increasing pressure and risk associated with their work. <a href=\"https://www.china.ifj.org/chapter-2-en\">Among</a> them were Citizen News, Mad Dog Daily, CLS, Internet Broadcasting Hong Kong, Dare Media HK, Polymer, and White Knight.</p>\n<p>When asked if Hong Kong\u2019s press freedom is deteriorating, then-city leader Carrie Lam <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/3162061/hong-kong-leader-carrie-lam-rejects-suggestions-national\">insisted</a> that these events are not related to the National Security Law. Similarly, pro-establishment media have labelled the closures as merely \u201c<a href=\"https://hongkongfp.com/2022/01/03/no-other-choice-hong-kong-citizen-news-says-decision-to-close-was-prompted-by-stand-news-arrests-staff-safety/\">self-inflicted</a>.\u201d</p>\n<p>In June 2022, Hong Kong-based news agency Factwire <a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/a/factwire-becomes-latest-hong-kong-media-outlet-to-close-/6612528.html\">disbanded</a> as well, citing concerns over how a potential fake news law could be weaponized against investigative journalism. Factwire was established in 2015 via a crowdfunding campaign with the support of more than 3,000 backers. Since then, it broke several major stories, including the exposure of quality issues of mass-transit trains and defects of a nearby nuclear power plant in Guangdong Province. The agency also <a href=\"https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2022/06/hong-kongs-factwire-news-agency-closes-further-cementing-government-control-over-media/\">won</a> the 2020 Human Rights Press Award.</p>\n<p>But also international media has been impacted. Soon after the enactment of the National Security Law, the New York Times decided to relocate their digital news operations to Seoul. There have also been instances in which foreign journalists were <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/economist-magazine-regrets-hong-kong-rejecting-its-journalists-visa-2021-11-13/\">denied</a> working visas, including Sue-lin Wong of The Economist. Meanwhile, Radio Free Asia also <a href=\"https://hongkongfp.com/2022/02/10/us-funded-news-service-to-suspend-cantonese-op-eds-and-programmes-over-dire-situation-in-hong-kong/\">announced</a> the suspension of Cantonese-language programs which could put Hong Kong-based contributors at risk. Soon after the demise of Apple Daily, subscription-based news site Initium Media <a href=\"https://hongkongfp.com/2021/08/03/in-media-first-hong-kong-news-outlet-initium-quits-city-for-singapore-over-security-law-fears/\">moved</a> its operations from Hong Kong to Singapore.</p>\n<p>Apart from all the independent and private outlets, Hong Kong\u2019s public broadcasting company, Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK), which was originally modelled after the BBC and understood itself as an impartial yet critical media outlet, has also been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/12/world/asia/hong-kong-rthk-crackdown-china.html\">reined</a> in. Following the backlash to a parody show, which mocked policemen during the social unrest in 2019, the organisation made significant personnel changes. Some reporters were seemingly <a href=\"https://hongkongfp.com/2021/09/21/radio-3-host-hugh-chiverton-disappears-from-airwaves-rthk-refuses-to-comment/\">reprimanded</a> for their confrontational attitude or <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3118909/rthk-terminates-long-term-contact-journalist-known-hard\">let go</a> altogether. Programs focusing on open debates were either <a href=\"https://hongkongfp.com/2020/06/21/curtain-falls-on-hong-kongs-oldest-satirical-tv-show/\">removed</a> or rebranded, and RTHK was, in its entirety, repositioned as a government <a href=\"https://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news/section/4/148875/RTHK-to-produce-TV-series-on-national-security-law\">mouthpiece</a>. In order to further dissociate itself from its critical past, the broadcaster also started <a href=\"https://hongkongfp.com/2021/05/03/hong-kong-broadcaster-rthk-to-delete-shows-over-a-year-old-from-internet-as-viewers-scramble-to-save-backups/\">deleting</a> content from its archive and social media channels.</p>\n<p>There are several media outlets remaining which defend their critical stance towards the government; however, their diversity and reach have been significantly reduced, while most also adopted certain editorial guidelines to minimise risks. One strategy seemed to be to add disclaimers to critical commentaries, though pro-government media have already started to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/krislc/status/1480680941374918656\">question</a> this practice.</p>\n<p>In a matter of just 20 years, Hong Kong has <a href=\"https://graphics.reuters.com/HONGKONG-ANNIVERSARY/zdvxoejkxpx/index.html\">dropped</a> from 18th to 148th in the World Press Freedom Ranking. On a local level, this number can be translated into less critical coverage, less investigative reporting, and a less appealing work environment for talented journalists.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Please visit the project page for more pieces from the\u00a0<a href=\"https://advox.globalvoices.org/special/unfreedom-monitor/\">Unfreedom Monitor</a>.</h3>\n\n</div>",

I understand the initial concern but we have to look at these issues with a discerning eye to see what the actual effects and their causes are.  At this point we are not sure if the concerns to this law will not be addressed and improve the law in the long run. I really hope that in the end all these concerns will actually lead to a more free Hong Kong and the people who live there.",

        "content": "<div class=\"entry\">\n<p>In recent days, a number of university campuses in Hong Kong have turned into major battlegrounds between anti-government protesters and riot police, as Hong Kong enters its eighth month of <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/specialcoverage/the-people-of-hong-kong-vs-the-china-extradition-bill/\">protests to defend its democratic rule.</a> On November 17, the campus of Hong Kong Polytechnic University became the site of some of the most violent clashes witnessed so far in Hong Kong.</p>\n<p>After more than 24 hours of crossfire between riot police officers using tear gas, projectile rounds, water cannons and long-range acoustic devices and protesters\u2019 fire-bombs, bricks and arrows, hundreds were still under siege inside the campus on Monday, November 18.</p>\n<p>Since the general strike that started on Monday, November 11, protesters have been attempting to block major roads in order to disrupt traffic to prompt a citywide strike. The disruptive acts led to <a href=\"https://globalvoices.org/2019/11/14/hong-kongs-university-campuses-turned-into-battlefields-amidst-a-three-day-strike/\">violent clashes in the Chinese University campus</a> in the area called New Territories in the northeast of Hong Kong between November 11 to November 14. After that, the battlefield gradually shifted to downtown to the Polytechnic University, as its campus is located next to a busy axis of the Hung Hum cross-harbor tunnel.</p>\n<p>The clashes took place mostly at the location of two bridges crossing over the cross harbor tunnel highway and connecting the Hung Hom railway station to the university main entrance. Since the beginning of the general strike, protesters have been throwing objects from the bridges to the highway and setting up defense lines near the university entrances.</p>\n<p>Tensions escalated on November 17 as the Hong Kong government wanted to restore order in the city after a week of protests and confrontations. The police <a href=\"https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/11/17/hong-kong-police-officer-hit-leg-arrow-outside-polyu-clashes-protesters/\">issued a statement</a> on that day, saying:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Police warn that violent activities in the Hong Kong Polytechnic University have escalated to rioting. Anyone who stays behind or assists rioters may be liable to the offence of \u2018Taking Part in a Riot\u2019.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The maximum penalty for rioting is a 10-year imprisonment sentence.</p>\n<p>At around 8:30 p.m., riot police advanced forward on the Cheong Wan Road bridge with two armoured trucks. Protesters responded with firebombs, and the police retreated after one of the trucks was set on fire.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Just tuned in from US time? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PolyU?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#PolyU</a> has been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HongKongProtests?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#HongKongProtests</a> battleground for two days.

Taking that all into mind, I can't agree that this is a step towards ending all protests and I definitely do not think this is the path to a dystopian nightmare. We should argue about whether the police went too far, but we shouldn't claim this is surely the end of the free world. We should also make clear that the protesters have to maintain peaceful protests, they endanger the right to protest by acting in a violent manner. That is the only way we will find a proper resolution, with peaceful discussions that bridge the gaps between the two parties. I hope that happens before anymore people are hurt!",

No, they will only clamp down more and more. More impositions, more repressive laws, probably culminating in violent, military action. Hong Kong will only hasten it becoming the next Xinjiang with these kinds of actions.",

I am sure there are some who love the Chinese government, but they are not the only voice in that country.
