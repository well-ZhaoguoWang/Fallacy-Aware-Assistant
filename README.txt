Logic Checker â€” Fallacy-Aware-Assistant
Please unzip my project, then open Google Chrome. Click the four-dot icon in the top-right corner, choose Extensions,
then Manage Extensions, click Load unpacked, select ex folder and select checker folder, and run flask_app.py in the main directory.

1) A floating window will appear. You can copy and paste any news context and comment to detect fallacies.
The window can be minimized or closed.

2) Open any Reddit post, right-click, and choose Batch Analyze (reddit only) to automatically analyze all comments in the thread.
(Due to platform API limitations, Reddit is currently the only supported platform.)

3) On any webpage, select a sentence, right-click, and choose Start checking for fallacies to analyze the selected text.
