Taking this line can lead to unforeseen consequences, as things can get out of control very quickly. First, they will be given the right to use pepper spray, but what comes after that? Perhaps blackjacks. And then? Maybe tasers. And after that? Probably guns. And then there would be a troubling new layer of violence in Jamaica. This kind of approach to solving problems can evolve rapidly and get away from you, eventually creating a whole new set of problems.

It's amazing that so many social media influencers have the power to incite violence, but lets not assume they are all eager to focus on once group and cause issue with them. We're seen so many influencers are the opposite and work to fight against injustices, many more are joining protests and and against the actions of hate groups. Of course, it's safe to say that all these influencers genuinely care about social justice and are not just doing it for the image and follows, right? We shouldn't lump them all together, okay? On the other hand, I saw an influencer last week who barely showed any interests in these issues until it started trending. It makes you wonder if they are just following trends or are they socially aware?",
